<h2 id="What-Is-Discord"><a href="#What-Is-Discord" class="headerlink" title="What Is Discord?"></a>What Is Discord?</h2><p>Discord has everything you need in a good communication software with its voice chats, video calls, and text options. These let users get in touch with each other, which works perfectly for gamers to form communities, coordinate, and talk while playing.</p>
<p>Primarily a chat app, it makes chatting while playing games on PC very convenient. However, it is not just used by gamers, as a lot of people use it as a social and organizational tool.</p>
<p>This past year, Discord has become the default destination for Youtubers, influencers, and Instagrammers who want to build a community around their content and connect with audiences in a more meaningful way.</p>
<h2 id="How-Does-Discord-Work-And-What-Can-It-Be-Used-For"><a href="#How-Does-Discord-Work-And-What-Can-It-Be-Used-For" class="headerlink" title="How Does Discord Work And What Can It Be Used For?"></a>How Does Discord Work And What Can It Be Used For?</h2><p>Discord is simply a communication software that allows the users to message or call one another. There are different communities on it, and each one is called a server, with individual text and voice channels for you to join. You can type, voice-chat, and share videos, links, images, music, etc.</p>
<p>You’ll find that each channel has a unique topic or rules; for instance, one channel could be dedicated to games while another to sharing pictures of dogs, etc.</p>
<p>Discord serves as a social forum where people form private or public servers and discuss their shared interests. You can even start your own server if you can’t find any worth joining for free. Try A Google search to find discord servers on your preferred topic or use the app’s own search engine to look for a new channel.</p>
<p>Who doesn’t like GIFs?</p>
<p>Discord allows you to add GIFs to your chats or mark your messages as spoilers using the “&#x2F;giphy” or “&#x2F;spoiler” commands, respectively.</p>
<p>It also lets you reach out to other people and directly message them to have a video or voice chat with them. Furthermore, it can also connect to other apps like Spotify or YouTube to improve your experience.</p>
<p>No matter what other activity you are doing, you can use Discord along with it. For instance, if your friends want to play a game, you can all launch the same Discord server and use any device to access it. Smack talk your friends’ Mortal Combat or Street Fighter skills to your heart’s content – no one’s judging!</p>
<p>Interestingly, day traders and investors also hopped on the bandwagon because it lets them multitask and stay connected like a pro.</p>
<p>If these features weren’t enough, Discord is also free to download and use. And if you love the experience of Discord, you can always upgrade and subscribe to Discord Nitro.</p>
<p>While Discord itself provides you a fantastic experience, Nitro improves it by many folds. It lets you access more features like larger file uploads, animated emojis, better-quality streaming options, and a lot more, only for $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year!</p>
<h2 id="What-Makes-Discord-Standout"><a href="#What-Makes-Discord-Standout" class="headerlink" title="What Makes Discord Standout?"></a>What Makes Discord Standout?</h2><p>There’s a reason why Discord has managed to garner over <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/746215/discord-user-number/" >300 million <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> registered users as of June 2020. Even though you can find many communication tools, the variety of chat options makes Discord stand out amongst others.</p>
<h3 id="1-Easy-To-Use-Interface"><a href="#1-Easy-To-Use-Interface" class="headerlink" title="1. Easy-To-Use Interface"></a>1. Easy-To-Use Interface</h3><p>Don’t we all look for an easy-to-use interface in the apps or websites we use?</p>
<p>Discord has a good UI along with all the best features from communication apps like Slack and Skype. It also puts in a lot of effort in making the voice chat more efficient so that it is of real help while playing games.</p>
<h3 id="2-Provides-A-Social-Forum"><a href="#2-Provides-A-Social-Forum" class="headerlink" title="2. Provides A Social Forum"></a>2. Provides A Social Forum</h3><p>One of the best things about Discord is that it is more than just a communications software. Users actually take advantage of its chat options to meet and talk to other like-minded people making it a great social media platform.</p>
<p>This means that Discord isn’t only good for gamers. You can use the private server to interact with friends or the public ones to make new ones.</p>
<h3 id="3-Setting-Up-Member-Roles"><a href="#3-Setting-Up-Member-Roles" class="headerlink" title="3. Setting Up Member Roles"></a>3. Setting Up Member Roles</h3><p>Another one of Discord’s advantage is that you can use various ways to configure its server when you create one. You can establish different roles for the community members, like making one for other moderators and administrators or special functions for the most active users.</p>
<p>This makes your server easier to manage, while the experience is quite rewarding for active users.</p>
<h3 id="4-Accessibility"><a href="#4-Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="4. Accessibility"></a>4. Accessibility</h3><p>As you will read below, one of the best facets of Discord is that you can use it even if you do not have a gaming PC in front of you. The web-based and mobile versions are relatively easy to use. At the same time, the downloadable PC program runs in the background while you play your games.</p>
<p>You can use its chat servers to interact with people from pretty much anywhere due to the multitude of platforms available.</p>
<h2 id="Where-Can-You-Use-Discord"><a href="#Where-Can-You-Use-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Where Can You Use Discord?"></a>Where Can You Use Discord?</h2><p>Whether you have Windows or Mac, you can download and use the app effortlessly.</p>
<p>You can also use it in-browser at its official website, though there are some limitations. For example, you won’t be able to detect audio devices or a webcam and screen-sharing feature to stream desktops or windows to other people.</p>
<p>If you want to use it on the go, try the iOS and Android apps that offer relatively similar features as the desktop one. They have recently added the screen sharing feature to the mobile version as well making it accessible for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Get-Started-On-Discord"><a href="#How-to-Get-Started-On-Discord" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Started On Discord?"></a>How to Get Started On Discord?</h2><p>Follow the guide below if you want to join Discord:</p>
<h3 id="1-Creating-A-Discord-Account"><a href="#1-Creating-A-Discord-Account" class="headerlink" title="1.  Creating A Discord Account"></a>1.  Creating A Discord Account</h3><p>Once you have downloaded Discord on your device, click on the register link option, and create an account. Fill out the fields with relevant information, including the email you will use. Then create a username and password, and hit the “Continue” button to proceed.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve entered the world of Discord. Do check your email to verify your account so you can enjoy the full functionality of this app. In case you haven’t received it, click the resend button.</p>
<h3 id="2-Joining-A-Server"><a href="#2-Joining-A-Server" class="headerlink" title="2.  Joining A Server"></a>2.  Joining A Server</h3><p>Creating your account is just the beginning. Let’s get to the most exciting bit, which is joining a server!</p>
<p>First and foremost, find the perfect server to join as there are many resources available. You can find different server communities through the search option. You can optimize your search by typing in a keyword to find one focused on a topic of your interest.</p>
<p>You will see servers pop up once you type in your keyword. Just click on the display card of the one that’s in line with your interests. It’s also possible to view the server before you join, and if you like it, you can select the “Join Server” option.</p>
<p>A little icon near the magnifying glass and the plus signs on the screen will be added representing the server you have joined; click on it to rejoin the server whenever you want.</p>
<h3 id="3-Adding-Friends"><a href="#3-Adding-Friends" class="headerlink" title="3.  Adding Friends"></a>3.  Adding Friends</h3><p>Adding friends is another exciting part of Discord, which is luckily very straightforward. Follow the easy guide to do so.</p>
<p>In the “Friends” tab, you can see options on the dashboard. Click on the green “Add friend” button to add someone. A screen will appear that will ask you to enter a friend’s username and #number. Press the “Send Friend Request” option after this, and you would have added your first friend!</p>
<p>You can find your username along with the number at the bottom of your dashboard, which you can let a friend know who wants to add you.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As you would’ve already gathered from above, Discord is a very cool and useful app. It is not just meant for communication but to also build a social platform where you can meet other people and form communities around the same interests.</p>

These let users get in touch with each other, which works perfectly for gamers to form communities, coordinate, and talk while playing.</p>
<p>Primarily a chat app, it makes chatting while playing games on PC very convenient. However, it is not just used by gamers, as a lot of people use it as a social and organizational tool.</p>
<p>This past year, Discord has become the default destination for Youtubers, influencers, and Instagrammers who want to build a community around their content and connect with audiences in a more meaningful way.</p>
<h2 id="How-Does-Discord-Work-And-What-Can-It-Be-Used-For-1"><a href="#How-Does-Discord-Work-And-What-Can-It-Be-Used-For-1" class="headerlink" title="How Does Discord Work And What Can It Be Used For?"></a>How Does Discord Work And What Can It Be Used For?</h2><p>Discord is simply a communication software that allows the users to message or call one another. There are different communities on it, and each one is called a server, with individual text and voice channels for you to join. You can type, voice-chat, and share videos, links, images, music, etc.</p>
<p>You’ll find that each channel has a unique topic or rules; for instance, one channel could be dedicated to games while another to sharing pictures of dogs, etc.</p>
<p>Discord serves as a social forum where people form private or public servers and discuss their shared interests. You can even start your own server if you can’t find any worth joining for free. Try A Google search to find discord servers on your preferred topic or use the app’s own search engine to look for a new channel.</p>
<p>Who doesn’t like GIFs?</p>
<p>Discord allows you to add GIFs to your chats or mark your messages as spoilers using the “&#x2F;giphy” or “&#x2F;spoiler” commands, respectively.</p>
<p>It also lets you reach out to other people and directly message them to have a video or voice chat with them. Furthermore, it can also connect to other apps like Spotify or YouTube to improve your experience.</p>
<p>No matter what other activity you are doing, you can use Discord along with it. For instance, if your friends want to play a game, you can all launch the same Discord server and use any device to access it. Smack talk your friends’ Mortal Combat or Street Fighter skills to your heart’s content – no one’s judging!</p>
<p>Interestingly, day traders and investors also hopped on the bandwagon because it lets them multitask and stay connected like a pro.</p>
<p>If these features weren’t enough, Discord is also free to download and use. And if you love the experience of Discord, you can always upgrade and subscribe to Discord Nitro.</p>
<p>While Discord itself provides you a fantastic experience, Nitro improves it by many folds. It lets you access more features like larger file uploads, animated emojis, better-quality streaming options, and a lot more, only for $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year!</p>

<p>If these features weren’t enough, Discord is also free to download and use. And if you love the experience of Discord, you can always upgrade and subscribe to Discord Nitro.</p>
<p>While Discord itself provides you a fantastic experience, Nitro improves it by many folds. It lets you access more features like larger file uploads, animated emojis, better-quality streaming options, and a lot more, only for $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year!</p>
<h2 id="What-Makes-Discord-Standout-3"><a href="#What-Makes-Discord-Standout-3" class="headerlink" title="What Makes Discord Standout?"></a>What Makes Discord Standout?</h2><p>There’s a reason why Discord has managed to garner over <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/746215/discord-user-number/" >300 million <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> registered users as of June 2020. Even though you can find many communication tools, the variety of chat options makes Discord stand out amongst others.</p>
<h3 id="1-Easy-To-Use-Interface-3"><a href="#1-Easy-To-Use-Interface-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Easy-To-Use Interface"></a>1. Easy-To-Use Interface</h3><p>Don’t we all look for an easy-to-use interface in the apps or websites we use?</p>
<p>Discord has a good UI along with all the best features from communication apps like Slack and Skype. It also puts in a lot of effort in making the voice chat more efficient so that it is of real help while playing games.</p>
<h3 id="2-Provides-A-Social-Forum-3"><a href="#2-Provides-A-Social-Forum-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Provides A Social Forum"></a>2. Provides A Social Forum</h3><p>One of the best things about Discord is that it is more than just a communications software. Users actually take advantage of its chat options to meet and talk to other like-minded people making it a great social media platform.</p>
<p>This means that Discord isn’t only good for gamers. You can use the private server to interact with friends or the public ones to make new ones.</p>
<h3 id="3-Setting-Up-Member-Roles-3"><a href="#3-Setting-Up-Member-Roles-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Setting Up Member Roles"></a>3. Setting Up Member Roles</h3><p>Another one of Discord’s advantage is that you can use various ways to configure its server when you create one. You can establish different roles for the community members, like making one for other moderators and administrators or special functions for the most active users.</p>
<p>This makes your server easier to manage, while the experience is quite rewarding for active users.</p>
<h3 id="4-Accessibility-3"><a href="#4-Accessibility-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Accessibility"></a>4. Accessibility</h3><p>As you will read below, one of the best facets of Discord is that you can use it even if you do not have a gaming PC in front of you. The web-based and mobile versions are relatively easy to use. At the same time, the downloadable PC program runs in the background while you play your games.</p>
<p>You can use its chat servers to interact with people from pretty much anywhere due to the multitude of platforms available.</p>
<h2 id="Where-Can-You-Use-Discord-3"><a href="#Where-Can-You-Use-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="Where Can You Use Discord?"></a>Where Can You Use Discord?</h2><p>Whether you have Windows or Mac, you can download and use the app effortlessly.</p>
<p>You can also use it in-browser at its official website, though there are some limitations. For example, you won’t be able to detect audio devices or a webcam and screen-sharing feature to stream desktops or windows to other people.</p>
<p>If you want to use it on the go, try the iOS and Android apps that offer relatively similar features as the desktop one. They have recently added the screen sharing feature to the mobile version as well making it accessible for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Get-Started-On-Discord-3"><a href="#How-to-Get-Started-On-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Started On Discord?"></a>How to Get Started On Discord?</h2><p>Follow the guide below if you want to join Discord:</p>

<p>You will see servers pop up once you type in your keyword. Just click on the display card of the one that’s in line with your interests. It’s also possible to view the server before you join, and if you like it, you can select the “Join Server” option.</p>
<p>A little icon near the magnifying glass and the plus signs on the screen will be added representing the server you have joined; click on it to rejoin the server whenever you want.</p>
<h3 id="3-Adding-Friends-3"><a href="#3-Adding-Friends-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  Adding Friends"></a>3.  Adding Friends</h3><p>Adding friends is another exciting part of Discord, which is luckily very straightforward. Follow the easy guide to do so.</p>
<p>In the “Friends” tab, you can see options on the dashboard. Click on the green “Add friend” button to add someone. A screen will appear that will ask you to enter a friend’s username and #number. Press the “Send Friend Request” option after this, and you would have added your first friend!</p>
<p>You can find your username along with the number at the bottom of your dashboard, which you can let a friend know who wants to add you.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As you would’ve already gathered from above, Discord is a very cool and useful app. It is not just meant for communication but to also build a social platform where you can meet other people and form communities around the same interests.</p>

<p>A part of the appeal of the popular multimedia messaging platform Discord is that users can assume online identities that present them in a favorable light. Since Discord serves to enable groups of friends or people with shared interests to communicate in real-time, standing out from the crowd and establishing a well-known and well-liked persona can be very challenging. Every element of presence on the platform contributes to the overall impression the user will make, and his profile picture is definitely one of the most impactful elements that go a long way towards identity building.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s important to note that Discord users can only use a single profile picture or avatar on the platform, and can’t switch them from one server to another.</strong></em> This rule serves to establish some accountability and familiarity and applies even to server administrators. With that in mind, choosing a great image to represent you everywhere on the Discord platform is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly. To help you do this the right way while respecting all the rules, we prepared a detailed guide for this process.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance"><a href="#Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance"></a>Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</h2><p>Like all other social networks and online communication services, Discord has a set of rules determining whether a certain image is suitable for use as an avatar.</p>
<p>First of all, you have to adhere to a size limit for technical reasons, as too large images would slow down the channel. On the other hand, too small images won’t be legible and can look bad due to pixelization. The most optimal image size you should use for your Discord profile photo is at least <strong>512 x 512 pixels</strong> – enough to be clearly visible and far above the <strong>180 x 180-pixel minimum</strong>.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use your real photo or likeness for your Discord avatar – in fact, you don’t have to use a realistic image at all. Discord allows the use of photographs as well as various types of illustrations and cartoon images and accepts JPG as well as the animated GIF format.</p>
<p>This gives you a lot of freedom to craft your new identity and uses some powerful imagery, either created from scratch or taken from the internet. However, there are still some community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your submission for a profile picture might be rejected for failing to meet Discord’s T&amp;C.</p>
<p>Basically, no NSFW images are allowed on Discord so you will have to avoid anything extreme or controversial. Pornographic content or explicit nudity is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions or promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality. You also need to stay away from violent imagery or anything depicting illegal activity, including drug use, racial discrimination, or mistreatment of animals. While this eliminates a lot of content, it still leaves enough room to express yourself freely without risking offending any other Discord users.</p>

It doesn’t take too much effort to make a fantastic avatar that will be completely unique and tell exactly the story you want. There are many different software tools you can use for this purpose, but since the task is very simple you can use a practical, free program such as Filmora.</p>
<p>The procedure of creating a profile picture for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complex and involves just a few simple steps.</p>
<p>You should start by identifying the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be an animated character or a real-life photo. You can search on Google image or download it from some discord profile sites.</p>
<p>Next, you need to load the selected image into a new project, and then resize the image to fit the preferred dimensions for Discord and change its shape to circular. To change the shape, go to Effects -&gt; Utility -&gt; Image Mask to optimize the image for a Discord avatar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="create discord avatar with Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>By adding overlays on top of the basic image, you can also introduce any visual or textual elements that will personalize the avatar even further. To get maximum attention, you might want to use a video or animation as part of the avatar – just add them to overlays and save your file as GIF. Since Discord allows GIF format, you can get an avatar that literally jumps off the page in every chat that you are a part of and elicits a strong reaction from those who see it.</p>

However, this is not done in the same way on different platforms, so you will need to follow the instructions for the type of system you normally use to access your Discord account.</p>

Clicking on this icon will take you to the User settings menu, where you need to find the My Account tab.</p>
<p>Next, hover with your mouse cursor over the current profile picture, then click on the icon that appears right next to it. This action will let you upload an image (JPG or GIF) from your hard drive and make it your new profile picture.</p>
<p><img

<p>Find the profile picture in the screen that opens, and tap on it to access your phone gallery, then choose the image you would like to use for identification on Discord. It will automatically be uploaded and replace the current image as your only avatar on all Discord channels until it’s changed again.</p>

Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?"></a>1. Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?</h4><p>If you experience this problem, it’s most likely a consequence of trying to make too many picture changes too fast. While Discord will allow you to upload two profile images in rapid succession, the third attempt within a few minutes is going to be unsuccessful. The problem will disappear if you wait for a short period of time and try uploading again. Another reason might be that your firewall is preventing you from using an image from a cloud server, but you can easily bypass the issue and download the picture first to your hard disc before uploading it to Discord from there.</p>

What do the colored dots next to my profile picture mean?</h4><p>Those dots indicate the current status of the user, with each color having a fixed meaning. If you see a green dot, the user is available to chat at the moment. A yellow dot indicated an idle user that hasn’t been active in a while, and the red color means the user is busy and doesn’t want to be disturbed. Finally, a gray dot confirms that the user is currently not signed in to his Discord account.</p>

Next, you need to activate the Inspect element window and copy the image URL from here. Pasting the URL into your browser will open the image and allow you to save it as you would do with any other picture from the internet.</p>

The most optimal image size you should use for your Discord profile photo is at least <strong>512 x 512 pixels</strong> – enough to be clearly visible and far above the <strong>180 x 180-pixel minimum</strong>.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use your real photo or likeness for your Discord avatar – in fact, you don’t have to use a realistic image at all. Discord allows the use of photographs as well as various types of illustrations and cartoon images and accepts JPG as well as the animated GIF format.</p>
<p>This gives you a lot of freedom to craft your new identity and uses some powerful imagery, either created from scratch or taken from the internet. However, there are still some community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your submission for a profile picture might be rejected for failing to meet Discord’s T&amp;C.</p>
<p>Basically, no NSFW images are allowed on Discord so you will have to avoid anything extreme or controversial. Pornographic content or explicit nudity is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions or promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality. You also need to stay away from violent imagery or anything depicting illegal activity, including drug use, racial discrimination, or mistreatment of animals. While this eliminates a lot of content, it still leaves enough room to express yourself freely without risking offending any other Discord users.</p>

It doesn’t take too much effort to make a fantastic avatar that will be completely unique and tell exactly the story you want. There are many different software tools you can use for this purpose, but since the task is very simple you can use a practical, free program such as Filmora.</p>
<p>The procedure of creating a profile picture for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complex and involves just a few simple steps.</p>
<p>You should start by identifying the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be an animated character or a real-life photo. You can search on Google image or download it from some discord profile sites.</p>
<p>Next, you need to load the selected image into a new project, and then resize the image to fit the preferred dimensions for Discord and change its shape to circular. To change the shape, go to Effects -&gt; Utility -&gt; Image Mask to optimize the image for a Discord avatar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="create discord avatar with Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>By adding overlays on top of the basic image, you can also introduce any visual or textual elements that will personalize the avatar even further. To get maximum attention, you might want to use a video or animation as part of the avatar – just add them to overlays and save your file as GIF. Since Discord allows GIF format, you can get an avatar that literally jumps off the page in every chat that you are a part of and elicits a strong reaction from those who see it.</p>

While Discord will allow you to upload two profile images in rapid succession, the third attempt within a few minutes is going to be unsuccessful. The problem will disappear if you wait for a short period of time and try uploading again. Another reason might be that your firewall is preventing you from using an image from a cloud server, but you can easily bypass the issue and download the picture first to your hard disc before uploading it to Discord from there.</p>

<p>A part of the appeal of the popular multimedia messaging platform Discord is that users can assume online identities that present them in a favorable light. Since Discord serves to enable groups of friends or people with shared interests to communicate in real-time, standing out from the crowd and establishing a well-known and well-liked persona can be very challenging. Every element of presence on the platform contributes to the overall impression the user will make, and his profile picture is definitely one of the most impactful elements that go a long way towards identity building.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s important to note that Discord users can only use a single profile picture or avatar on the platform, and can’t switch them from one server to another.</strong></em> This rule serves to establish some accountability and familiarity and applies even to server administrators. With that in mind, choosing a great image to represent you everywhere on the Discord platform is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly. To help you do this the right way while respecting all the rules, we prepared a detailed guide for this process.</p>

<p>A part of the appeal of the popular multimedia messaging platform Discord is that users can assume online identities that present them in a favorable light. Since Discord serves to enable groups of friends or people with shared interests to communicate in real-time, standing out from the crowd and establishing a well-known and well-liked persona can be very challenging. Every element of presence on the platform contributes to the overall impression the user will make, and his profile picture is definitely one of the most impactful elements that go a long way towards identity building.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s important to note that Discord users can only use a single profile picture or avatar on the platform, and can’t switch them from one server to another.</strong></em> This rule serves to establish some accountability and familiarity and applies even to server administrators. With that in mind, choosing a great image to represent you everywhere on the Discord platform is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly. To help you do this the right way while respecting all the rules, we prepared a detailed guide for this process.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance-3"><a href="#Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance"></a>Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</h2><p>Like all other social networks and online communication services, Discord has a set of rules determining whether a certain image is suitable for use as an avatar.</p>
<p>First of all, you have to adhere to a size limit for technical reasons, as too large images would slow down the channel. On the other hand, too small images won’t be legible and can look bad due to pixelization. The most optimal image size you should use for your Discord profile photo is at least <strong>512 x 512 pixels</strong> – enough to be clearly visible and far above the <strong>180 x 180-pixel minimum</strong>.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use your real photo or likeness for your Discord avatar – in fact, you don’t have to use a realistic image at all. Discord allows the use of photographs as well as various types of illustrations and cartoon images and accepts JPG as well as the animated GIF format.</p>
<p>This gives you a lot of freedom to craft your new identity and uses some powerful imagery, either created from scratch or taken from the internet. However, there are still some community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your submission for a profile picture might be rejected for failing to meet Discord’s T&amp;C.</p>
<p>Basically, no NSFW images are allowed on Discord so you will have to avoid anything extreme or controversial. Pornographic content or explicit nudity is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions or promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality. You also need to stay away from violent imagery or anything depicting illegal activity, including drug use, racial discrimination, or mistreatment of animals. While this eliminates a lot of content, it still leaves enough room to express yourself freely without risking offending any other Discord users.</p>

It doesn’t take too much effort to make a fantastic avatar that will be completely unique and tell exactly the story you want. There are many different software tools you can use for this purpose, but since the task is very simple you can use a practical, free program such as Filmora.</p>
<p>The procedure of creating a profile picture for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complex and involves just a few simple steps.</p>
<p>You should start by identifying the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be an animated character or a real-life photo. You can search on Google image or download it from some discord profile sites.</p>
<p>Next, you need to load the selected image into a new project, and then resize the image to fit the preferred dimensions for Discord and change its shape to circular. To change the shape, go to Effects -&gt; Utility -&gt; Image Mask to optimize the image for a Discord avatar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-overlay-image-mask-discord-profile-wondershare-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="create discord avatar with Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>By adding overlays on top of the basic image, you can also introduce any visual or textual elements that will personalize the avatar even further. To get maximum attention, you might want to use a video or animation as part of the avatar – just add them to overlays and save your file as GIF. Since Discord allows GIF format, you can get an avatar that literally jumps off the page in every chat that you are a part of and elicits a strong reaction from those who see it.</p>

However, this is not done in the same way on different platforms, so you will need to follow the instructions for the type of system you normally use to access your Discord account.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Change-Avatars-on-Discord-Desktop-Computer-3"><a href="#How-to-Change-Avatars-on-Discord-Desktop-Computer-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Avatars on Discord Desktop Computer?"></a>How to Change Avatars on Discord Desktop Computer?</h3><p>Open your Discord app (Mac or Windows version) and look for a gear icon in the bottom left corner of your screen. Clicking on this icon will take you to the User settings menu, where you need to find the My Account tab.</p>
<p>Next, hover with your mouse cursor over the current profile picture, then click on the icon that appears right next to it. This action will let you upload an image (JPG or GIF) from your hard drive and make it your new profile picture.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change discord avatar"
                ></p>
<p>Keep in mind that Discord will automatically crop images that are not already in a circular format, so you need to make sure that the image is well centered before uploading.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Change-Discord-Avatars-on-Mobile-Devices-3"><a href="#How-to-Change-Discord-Avatars-on-Mobile-Devices-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Discord Avatars on Mobile Devices?"></a>How to Change Discord Avatars on Mobile Devices?</h3><p>The procedure for changing the profile avatar on Discord from a mobile device is equally straightforward, and it’s similar on both Android and iOS phones. After you open the app, you need to tap on the icon in the right bottom corner to access the Account menu.</p>
<p>Find the profile picture in the screen that opens, and tap on it to access your phone gallery, then choose the image you would like to use for identification on Discord. It will automatically be uploaded and replace the current image as your only avatar on all Discord channels until it’s changed again.</p>

Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?"></a>1. Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?</h4><p>If you experience this problem, it’s most likely a consequence of trying to make too many picture changes too fast. While Discord will allow you to upload two profile images in rapid succession, the third attempt within a few minutes is going to be unsuccessful. The problem will disappear if you wait for a short period of time and try uploading again. Another reason might be that your firewall is preventing you from using an image from a cloud server, but you can easily bypass the issue and download the picture first to your hard disc before uploading it to Discord from there.</p>
<h4 id="2-How-can-I-find-my-old-profile-picture-3"><a href="#2-How-can-I-find-my-old-profile-picture-3" class="headerlink" title="2. How can I find my old profile picture?"></a>2. How can I find my old profile picture?</h4><p>All of the images you previously used as Discord avatars remain memorized and can be reactivated at any time. You can find this collection of images on a specific portion of your profile page, so if you want to use any of them you can simply click on them without having to go through the regular upload process all over again.</p>
