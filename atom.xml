You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.</p><p>Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.</p><p>One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Best Screen Recorder Software for Discord Desktop App</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord"></a>Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.</p><h3 id="1-OBS"><a href="#1-OBS" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS"></a>1. OBS</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.</p><p>There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.</p><h3 id="2-Bandicam"><a href="#2-Bandicam" class="headerlink" title="2. Bandicam"></a>2. Bandicam</h3><p>Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.</p><p>Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn’t involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.</p><h3 id="3-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#3-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="3. Wondershare Filmora"></a>3. Wondershare Filmora</h3><p>Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, webcam recording, and audio recording tools.

DemoCreator</h3><p>If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/" >Wondershare DemoCreator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.</p><p>You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.</p><h3 id="5-Camtasia"><a href="#5-Camtasia" class="headerlink" title="5. Camtasia"></a>5. Camtasia</h3><p>If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then <a class="link"   href="https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html" >Camtasia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.</p><p>However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord"></a>Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</h2><p>If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.</p><h3 id="2-Screen-Capture"><a href="#2-Screen-Capture" class="headerlink" title="2. Screen Capture"></a>2. Screen Capture</h3><p>One such option is <a class="link"   href="https://www.screencapture.com/" >Screen Capture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.</p><p>There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.</p><h3 id="3-Clipchamp"><a href="#3-Clipchamp" class="headerlink" title="3. Clipchamp"></a>3. Clipchamp</h3><p>If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer <a class="link"   href="https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/" >Clipchamp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.</p><p>It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.</p><h3 id="3-Screencast-o-matic"><a href="#3-Screencast-o-matic" class="headerlink" title="3. Screencast-o-matic"></a>3. Screencast-o-matic</h3><p>The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is <a class="link"   href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder" >Screencast-o-matic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.</p><p>The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android"><a href="#Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android"></a>Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.</p><h3 id="1-AZ-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#1-AZ-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="1. AZ Screen Recorder"></a>1. AZ Screen Recorder</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >AZ Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.</p><p>It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.</p><h3 id="2-Screen-Recorder-for-Game-Video-Call-Screenshots"><a href="#2-Screen-Recorder-for-Game-Video-Call-Screenshots" class="headerlink" title="2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots"></a>2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots</h3><p>Another option for Android is <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.</p><p>The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.</p><h3 id="3-Record-It"><a href="#3-Record-It" class="headerlink" title="3. Record It"></a>3. Record It</h3><p>If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545" >Record It! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.</p><p>The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Record-Discord-Video-Screen-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Record-Discord-Video-Screen-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</h2><p>If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.</p><p>Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.</p><p>You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.</p><p>If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.</p><p>Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.</p><p>The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.</p><p><a

You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.</p><p>Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.</p><p>One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Best Screen Recorder Software for Discord Desktop App</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord"></a>Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.</p><h3 id="1-OBS"><a href="#1-OBS" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS"></a>1. OBS</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.</p><p>There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.</p><h3 id="2-Bandicam"><a href="#2-Bandicam" class="headerlink" title="2. Bandicam"></a>2. Bandicam</h3><p>Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.</p><p>Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn’t involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.</p><h3 id="3-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#3-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="3. Wondershare Filmora"></a>3. Wondershare Filmora</h3><p>Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><h3 id="4-DemoCreator"><a href="#4-DemoCreator" class="headerlink" title="4.

Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.</p><p>You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.</p><h3 id="5-Camtasia"><a href="#5-Camtasia" class="headerlink" title="5. Camtasia"></a>5. Camtasia</h3><p>If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then <a class="link"   href="https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html" >Camtasia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.</p><p>However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord"></a>Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</h2><p>If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.</p><h3 id="2-Screen-Capture"><a href="#2-Screen-Capture" class="headerlink" title="2. Screen Capture"></a>2. Screen Capture</h3><p>One such option is <a class="link"   href="https://www.screencapture.com/" >Screen Capture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.</p><p>There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.</p><h3 id="3-Clipchamp"><a href="#3-Clipchamp" class="headerlink" title="3. Clipchamp"></a>3. Clipchamp</h3><p>If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer <a class="link"   href="https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/" >Clipchamp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.</p><p>It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.</p><h3 id="3-Screencast-o-matic"><a href="#3-Screencast-o-matic" class="headerlink" title="3. Screencast-o-matic"></a>3. Screencast-o-matic</h3><p>The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is <a class="link"   href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder" >Screencast-o-matic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.</p><p>The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android"><a href="#Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android"></a>Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.</p><h3 id="1-AZ-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#1-AZ-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="1. AZ Screen Recorder"></a>1. AZ Screen Recorder</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >AZ Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.</p><p>It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.</p><h3 id="2-Screen-Recorder-for-Game-Video-Call-Screenshots"><a href="#2-Screen-Recorder-for-Game-Video-Call-Screenshots" class="headerlink" title="2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots"></a>2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots</h3><p>Another option for Android is <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.</p><p>The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.</p><h3 id="3-Record-It"><a href="#3-Record-It" class="headerlink" title="3. Record It"></a>3. Record It</h3><p>If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545" >Record It! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.</p><p>The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Record-Discord-Video-Screen-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Record-Discord-Video-Screen-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</h2><p>If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.</p><p>Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.</p><p>You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.</p><p>If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.</p><p>Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.</p><p>The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-process-to-make-professional-discord-photos/"><u>In 2024, Step-By-Step Process to Make Professional Discord Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-optimal-zero-price-logo-maker-for-discord-channels-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Optimal Zero-Price Logo Maker for Discord Channels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-logo-evolutions-for-online-communities/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Top Logo Evolutions for Online Communities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-streamline-your-life-quick-tips-to-beginning-on-discord-broadcasts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Streamline Your Life  Quick Tips to Beginning on Discord Broadcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-conduct-a-chat-symphony-with-discord-tts-capabilities/"><u>In 2024, Conduct a Chat Symphony with Discord TTS Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/captivate-conversations-essential-cool-channel-titles-for-2024/"><u>Captivate Conversations  Essential Cool Channel Titles for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-advanced-virtual-meeting-spaces-beyond-discord-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Advanced Virtual Meeting Spaces Beyond Discord for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-conquer-discords-profile-pics-with-style-and-elegance/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Conquer Discord's Profile Pics with Style and Elegance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-uncovering-the-wonders-of-discord-nitro-free-and-paid-insights/"><u>In 2024, Uncovering the Wonders of Discord Nitro -

Even though Discord makes communication easier, you may need a break from around-the-clock connectivity for various reasons.</p><p>Discord works on desktop platforms and smartphones, with a blend of a VoIP chat system, a chat lobby, and a message board in a single app. Therefore, you can attempt to delete a server off on any device that you may have Discord downloaded and active on.</p><p>Most server owners choose to delete their Discord server when too many extra, strange, or ill-meaning visitors are visiting.</p><p>Servers are more like chat rooms inside the application. Deleting them is a relatively simple process – as you will learn from our <strong>how to delete server on Discord</strong> tips – however, their retrieval is impossible.</p><p>Once the server has been removed, you can not “undo the process” or recreate it. Therefore, be absolutely sure and proceed with caution.</p><p>It is also advised to skim through any essential files that you might have on the server. Back them up before letting it go forever.</p><p>And lastly, ensure that this is what you intend on doing because deleting a Discord server is permanent. Here are the simple steps to follow on <strong>how to delete a server on Discord</strong>:</p><ol><li>Open the Discord desktop app and click on the server you want to delete</li><li>Once you select the server, there will be an options list under the server’s name</li><li>Click the “server setting” button from the menu (This will be the second option on the list)</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-settings.jpg"                      alt="Discord Server Settings"                ></p><ol><li>At the end of the sidebar, you will find the option “delete the server on the left side.” Click it</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deleting-discord-server-overview.jpg"                      alt="Discord Server Overview"                ></p><p><strong>Image</strong>: <em>The image shows the screen that pops up after clicking “Server settings,” here, the delete button can be seen in red.</em></p><ol><li>After clicking, a pop-up window will appear, asking for confirmation</li><li>Confirm by entering the server’s name and authentication code; this is only required when two-factor authentication is enabled</li><li>Click on “delete server” to confirm</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/double-confirm-to-delete-server.jpg"                      alt="Discord Server delete confirm"                ></p><p><strong>Image:</strong> <em>As mentioned, you must be sure you want to permanently lose a server and all of its content before deleting it; this prompt serves the same purpose</em></p><p>You can also transfer your server’s ownership to another individual if you do not want to delete it.

And here is how to do it –</p><ol><li>Open the Discord app on your phone.</li><li>Tap those ‘three parallel lines’ buttons located on the top left.</li><li>Tap the Friends symbol that appears on the bottom tab.</li><li>Tap on the ‘Add Friends’ button and you will see two tabs: Username and Nearby Scan. Select the Nearby Scan option.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-on-discord-mobile-without-number.jpg"                      alt="add friends to server on Discord mobile without numbers"                ></p><ol><li>Ask your friend to turn on the Nearby Scan mode on their phone too.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-nearby-scan-discord.jpg"                      alt="add friends to server on Discord mobile with nearby scan feature"                ></p><ol><li>When your friend gets detected, they appear on the radar.</li><li>Hit the ‘Send’ button to send a Friend Request.</li><li>Once they accept your request, they will make their way to your Friends List.</li></ol><p>Note that this method only works on the mobile app (it doesn’t matter if you have an Android phone or iPhone). You cannot perform this with a PC or laptop.</p><p>Further, you and your friend both must be on the Nearby Scan mode to connect with this feature. This method only works for connections that are within a 10-meter radius. So, if your pal is from a whole different continent, you will need a user tag to add them as friends.</p><p>If you and the person you want to add are on the same server, you can add them through the channel user lists, as we discussed above.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Add-friends-on-Discord-without-user-tag-via-an-invitation-link"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Add-friends-on-Discord-without-user-tag-via-an-invitation-link" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Add friends on Discord without user tag via an invitation link"></a>Bonus: How to Add friends on Discord without user tag via an invitation link</h2><p>On Discord channels, it always ‘the more, the merrier.’ And your server can be one lonely place without friends. Plus, adding friends via a server is a lot easier and needs fewer steps. Create a server and customize it according to your taste. Don’t forget to add bots for fun!</p><ol><li>Open your discord, and head over to the server that you want to add friends to.</li><li>Right-click on the server title. A menu with several options will appear.</li><li>From that list, choose ‘invite friends’ and an invite link will appear on the pop-up menu.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-to-discord-server-via-invitation-link.jpg"                      alt="add friends to Discord Server via invitation links"                ></p><ol><li>The invitation link typically expires in a day.

Here, click on the ‘send friend request’ option.</li></ol><p>The person will receive the request. Upon approval, the friend will be added to your Friends list.

You can obsess about some game, comic, or song with hundreds of other people without the fear of being called geeky.</p><p>However, sometimes you might disagree with other members, which can lead you to hunt for some other server. Other times, the server might be inactive, or you may not mix well with the crowd. Or maybe, you landed there by mistake. So, <strong>how do you leave a Discord server</strong>?</p><p>Whatever your reason, here is a detailed guide on how to leave a server on Discord!</p><p>A few things to note before you leave a server –</p><ul><li>After you exit from a server, you will no longer be able to send any texts on it.</li><li>You will not receive any notifications from the server.</li><li>Your username will no longer appear in the member list of the server.</li><li>Whatever role you had in the server will be disabled.</li><li>If you own a server, you will have to transfer the ownership to another member before you quit.</li><li>The person you hand over your server to can do whatever they want with it.</li><li>You can join the server you left again if you change your mind.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Leave-a-Discord-Server-on-Computer"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Leave-a-Discord-Server-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Leave a Discord Server on Computer?"></a>Part 1: How to Leave a Discord Server on Computer?</h2><p>Several peoples and hardcore gamers use Discord over a PC. And you can wave goodbye to the channel in a matter of few seconds. The procedure is the same for Mac and Windows.</p><ol><li>Open Discord on your computer (the desktop app or on the browser).</li><li>Tap on the server name that appears towards the top left.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/leave-discord-server.jpg"                      alt="Leave Discord Server"                ></p><ol><li>Right at the bottom of the list, click on the option leave server</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/confirm-leaving-discord-server.jpg"                      alt="Leave Discord Server Confirm"                ></p><p>After confirming you won’t be a part of that server anymore.

To quit a server, follow these steps -</p><ol><li>Click open the Discord app on your mobile.</li><li>Click on the right pane and click on the 3 dots that appear. Click on the name of the server that you want to leave.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/leave-discord-server-mobile.jpg"                      alt="Leave Discord Server on Mobile"                ></p><ol><li>From the menu that opens, scroll towards the bottom and click on the leave server option.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/confirm-leaving-discord-server-mobile.jpg"                      alt="Leave Discord Server on Mobile Confirm"                ></p><p>After confirmation, you will not be a part of the server anymore. The process is the same for ios and Android devices.</p><p>If you have decided to take a break from gaming and Discord, you can consider uninstalling the app temporarily. You can also turn off the notifications in the app settings on your device.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Transfer-Discord-Server-Ownership"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Transfer-Discord-Server-Ownership" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Transfer Discord Server Ownership?"></a>Bonus: How to Transfer Discord Server Ownership?</h2><p>How to leave your own Discord server? If your server has many members in it, it is wiser to transfer the ownership rather than shutting the server completely or abandoning it to fate. Especially if the users are active, then you can handover the ownership to a trustworthy person.</p><p>Here is how you can do it -</p><p><strong>For desktop</strong></p><p>The process is quite simple and only takes a few minutes.</p><ol><li>Open the Discord app or log in using the browser.</li><li>Click on the server that you want to leave.</li><li>With right-click, open up the floating menu.</li><li>From that list, select server settings and then choose members.</li><li>Select the user that You Want To handover your server to. Tap those 3 dots and tap on ‘transfer ownership.’</li><li>Confirm your choice and then click on transfer ownership.</li><li>The chosen member will become the new owner of the server.</li></ol><p><strong>On mobile</strong></p><p>The transfer procedure is quite similar to the desktop version. However, it has a few extra steps.</p><ol><li>Open your Discord App on your phone.</li><li>Select the server that you want to give away.</li><li>Tap those 3 dots to open up the menu. Under user management, tap on ‘members.’</li><li>Select the member that will be the new owner of your server. Tap the 3 dots that appear next to the name of that user.</li><li>A confirmation box will appear.</li><li>Check off the box to confirm your choice.</li></ol><p>Your server is now successfully transferred to the selected member. And the new owner can decide what to do with the server.</p><p>FAQs About Leaving A Discord Server</p><ol><li>How can I leave a Discord server without anyone knowing?</li></ol><p>Frankly speaking, there is no magic to help conceal your disappearance from a server. There is no way to hide your departure. However, you can take a few measures to make it less noticeable.</p><ul><li>Lay low for a few hours or days. This won’t work if you are the loudest member on the server. But still, it’s worth a shot.</li><li>Try changing your avatar, profile picture, and nickname. This can throw people off the track or confuse them for a while.</li><li>Control yourself and try not to tell anyone that you are leaving.</li><li>And now it’s time for the discreet farewell!</li></ul><p>You might still get some texts on personal asking about your exit. This is not a surefire way of making your exit a secret. However, hundreds of members along with bots will make your disappearance less apparent. Another solution would be to create a new user ID and leave the old one inactive.</p><ol><li>Does leaving a Discord server delete your messages?</li></ol><p>No, none of the texts that you sent on the server get deleted. Every text remains, even after you leave. The only way you can delete your texts if you delete them all one by one, or someone with sufficient permissions deletes them. If you get banned, then the member who banned you decides whether to keep your messages on the server or remove them. In this case, your texts can be removed if the member deletes them.</p><p>This was a guide on ‘<strong>how to leave a Discord server’</strong> that provided a detailed how-to on leaving servers and transferring servers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/comparative-review-finding-your-teams-preferred-chat-application-slack-or-discord-for-2024/"><u>Comparative Review  Finding Your Team's Preferred Chat Application - Slack or Discord for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/master-your-presence-the-complete-guide-to-altering-status-and-avatars-for-2024/"><u>Master Your Presence  The Complete Guide to Altering Status & Avatars for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-sever-link-pc-and-mobile-devices-discord/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Sever Link - PC & Mobile Devices  Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-navigate-and-network-adding-desktopmobile-friends/"><u>In 2024, Navigate & Network  Adding Desktop/Mobile Friends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-themed-realm-the-ultimate-10-bestdiscord-choices/"><u>In 2024, Themed Realm  The Ultimate 10 BestDiscord Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exclusive-ai-companions-for-discorders/"><u>2024 Approved  Exclusive AI Companions for Discorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-essential-voicemod-playbook-transform-your-desktop-and-mobile-discords/"><u>[Updated] The Essential Voicemod Playbook  Transform Your Desktop & Mobile Discords</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-discover-the-hottest-channel-names-for-recognition-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Discover the Hottest Channel Names for Recognition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-font-fabrication-services-for-discord-channels-iosandroid/"><u>2024 Approved  Top Font Fabrication Services for Discord Channels (iOS/Android)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-tracking-apps-to-track-vivo-s17-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 5 Tracking Apps to Track Vivo S17 without Them Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-tiktok-video-steal-mode-iphone-edition/"><u>[New] In 2024, TikTok Video Steal Mode  IPhone Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-seamless-tiktok-conversion-pure-mp4-extractors-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  Seamless TikTok Conversion  Pure MP4 Extractors Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unleash-your-creativity-with-minitool-movie-maker-review-instructions-and-options/"><u>2024 Approved Unleash Your Creativity with Minitool Movie Maker Review, Instructions, and Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-your-pathway-to-perfect-igtv-footage-from-phone-to-dslr/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Your Pathway to Perfect IGTV Footage  From Phone to DSLR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-tier-gratis-mp3-integration-suites-for-the-modern-ear/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Top-Tier, Gratis MP3 Integration Suites for the Modern Ear</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-make-an-intro-video-easy-solution/"><u>New 2024 Approved How to Make an Intro Video Easy Solution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-best-free-gaming-platforms-top-10-sites-for-pc-and-android-downloads/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Best Free Gaming Platforms Top 10 Sites for PC and Android Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-list-10-best-online-gaming-intro-makers/"><u>Updated The Ultimate List 10 Best Online Gaming Intro Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/in-2024-live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential/"><u>In 2024, Live Commerce Next Chapter Can AI Unlock Its True Potential?</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

If your server has many members in it, it is wiser to transfer the ownership rather than shutting the server completely or abandoning it to fate. Especially if the users are active, then you can handover the ownership to a trustworthy person.</p><p>Here is how you can do it -</p><p><strong>For desktop</strong></p><p>The process is quite simple and only takes a few minutes.</p><ol><li>Open the Discord app or log in using the browser.</li><li>Click on the server that you want to leave.</li><li>With right-click, open up the floating menu.</li><li>From that list, select server settings and then choose members.</li><li>Select the user that You Want To handover your server to. Tap those 3 dots and tap on ‘transfer ownership.’</li><li>Confirm your choice and then click on transfer ownership.</li><li>The chosen member will become the new owner of the server.</li></ol><p><strong>On mobile</strong></p><p>The transfer procedure is quite similar to the desktop version. However, it has a few extra steps.</p><ol><li>Open your Discord App on your phone.</li><li>Select the server that you want to give away.</li><li>Tap those 3 dots to open up the menu. Under user management, tap on ‘members.’</li><li>Select the member that will be the new owner of your server. Tap the 3 dots that appear next to the name of that user.</li><li>A confirmation box will appear.</li><li>Check off the box to confirm your choice.</li></ol><p>Your server is now successfully transferred to the selected member. And the new owner can decide what to do with the server.</p><p>FAQs About Leaving A Discord Server</p><ol><li>How can I leave a Discord server without anyone knowing?</li></ol><p>Frankly speaking, there is no magic to help conceal your disappearance from a server. There is no way to hide your departure. However, you can take a few measures to make it less noticeable.</p><ul><li>Lay low for a few hours or days. This won’t work if you are the loudest member on the server. But still, it’s worth a shot.</li><li>Try changing your avatar, profile picture, and nickname. This can throw people off the track or confuse them for a while.</li><li>Control yourself and try not to tell anyone that you are leaving.</li><li>And now it’s time for the discreet farewell!</li></ul><p>You might still get some texts on personal asking about your exit. This is not a surefire way of making your exit a secret. However, hundreds of members along with bots will make your disappearance less apparent. Another solution would be to create a new user ID and leave the old one inactive.</p><ol><li>Does leaving a Discord server delete your messages?</li></ol><p>No, none of the texts that you sent on the server get deleted. Every text remains, even after you leave. The only way you can delete your texts if you delete them all one by one, or someone with sufficient permissions deletes them. If you get banned, then the member who banned you decides whether to keep your messages on the server or remove them. In this case, your texts can be removed if the member deletes them.</p><p>This was a guide on ‘<strong>how to leave a Discord server’</strong> that provided a detailed how-to on leaving servers and transferring servers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/navigating-and-mastering-discords-text-to-speech-tools-for-2024/"><u>Navigating and Mastering Discord's Text-to-Speech Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-navigating-the-maze-of-online-conflict-your-pathway-to-filing-a-report-on-discord/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Navigating the Maze of Online Conflict  Your Pathway to Filing a Report on Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-get-discord-partner-and-be-verified/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How To Get Discord Partner And Be Verified</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-optimal-audio-bots-guide-unleashing-peak-performance-in-discord/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Optimal Audio Bots Guide  Unleashing Peak Performance in Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-delve-into-nitro-the-advantages-of-discord-vip-service/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Delve Into Nitro  The Advantages of Discord VIP Service</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-discord-spoilers-key-insights-revealed/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Discord Spoilers  Key Insights Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-avoiding-consequences-when-quitting-discord-spaces/"><u>[New] In 2024, Avoiding Consequences When Quitting Discord Spaces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-terminate-your-own-discord-server-pcmobile/"><u>[New] In 2024, How to Terminate Your Own Discord Server (PC/Mobile)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unveiling-methods-to-easily-find-lesser-known-discord-servers/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unveiling  Methods to Easily Find Lesser-Known Discord Servers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/2024-approved-electorate-engagement-experience-top-gaming-selections/"><u>2024 Approved  Electorate Engagement Experience  Top Gaming Selections</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-from-free-to-profitable-unlocking-youtubes-monetization-at-500plus/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  From Free to Profitable  Unlocking YouTube's Monetization at 500+</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/smart-tv-meets-social-networks-televising-fb-content-for-2024/"><u>Smart TV Meets Social Networks  Televising FB Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/get-ready-to-be-amazed-the-best-4k-video-samples-around/"><u>Get Ready to Be Amazed The Best 4K Video Samples Around</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/clear-up-your-photos-best-10-online-image-enhancers-revealed/"><u>Clear Up Your Photos  Best 10 Online Image Enhancers Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/024-approved-unified-streaming-techniques-for-youtube-and-top-networks/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unified Streaming Techniques for YouTube & Top Networks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/2024s-cloud-price-tracker-find-the-lowest-bills-here/"><u>2024'S Cloud Price Tracker  Find the Lowest Bills Here</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-how-to-dominate-the-viral-video-edit-scene-on-tiktok-for-2024/"><u>[New] How to Dominate the Viral Video Edit Scene on TikTok for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-smirk-spotlights-showcasing-7-comedic-content-pieces/"><u>[New] Smirk Spotlights  Showcasing 7 Comedic Content Pieces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-archive-hunt-accessing-yesteryears-facebook-stories/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Archive Hunt  Accessing Yesteryear's Facebook Stories</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Since Discord serves to enable groups of friends or people with shared interests to communicate in real-time, standing out from the crowd and establishing a well-known and well-liked persona can be very challenging. Every element of presence on the platform contributes to the overall impression the user will make, and his profile picture is definitely one of the most impactful elements that go a long way towards identity building.</p><p><em><strong>It’s important to note that Discord users can only use a single profile picture or avatar on the platform, and can’t switch them from one server to another.</strong></em> This rule serves to establish some accountability and familiarity and applies even to server administrators. With that in mind, choosing a great image to represent you everywhere on the Discord platform is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly. To help you do this the right way while respecting all the rules, we prepared a detailed guide for this process.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#part1">Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part2">Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Create A Discord Avatar in Filmora?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part5">Part 5: Frequently Asked Questions About Discord PFP</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance"><a href="#Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance"></a>Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</h2><p>Like all other social networks and online communication services, Discord has a set of rules determining whether a certain image is suitable for use as an avatar.</p><p>First of all, you have to adhere to a size limit for technical reasons, as too large images would slow down the channel. On the other hand, too small images won’t be legible and can look bad due to pixelization. The most optimal image size you should use for your Discord profile photo is at least <strong>512 x 512 pixels</strong> – enough to be clearly visible and far above the <strong>180 x 180-pixel minimum</strong>.</p><p>You don’t have to use your real photo or likeness for your Discord avatar – in fact, you don’t have to use a realistic image at all. Discord allows the use of photographs as well as various types of illustrations and cartoon images and accepts JPG as well as the animated GIF format.</p><p>This gives you a lot of freedom to craft your new identity and uses some powerful imagery, either created from scratch or taken from the internet. However, there are still some community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your submission for a profile picture might be rejected for failing to meet Discord’s T&amp;C.</p><p>Basically, no NSFW images are allowed on Discord so you will have to avoid anything extreme or controversial. Pornographic content or explicit nudity is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions or promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality. You also need to stay away from violent imagery or anything depicting illegal activity, including drug use, racial discrimination, or mistreatment of animals. While this eliminates a lot of content, it still leaves enough room to express yourself freely without risking offending any other Discord users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-Download"><a href="#Part-2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-Download" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download"></a>Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download</h2><p>If you want to download a cool Discord profile picture, you can check the following websites:</p><h4 id="1-discordavatars-com"><a href="#1-discordavatars-com" class="headerlink" title="1. discordavatars.com"></a>1. discordavatars.com</h4><p>This website collects free Discord avatars and profile pictures, which allow you to download without any limitations.

It doesn’t take too much effort to make a fantastic avatar that will be completely unique and tell exactly the story you want. There are many different software tools you can use for this purpose, but since the task is very simple you can use a practical, free program such as Filmora.</p><p>The procedure of creating a profile picture for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complex and involves just a few simple steps.</p><p>You should start by identifying the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be an animated character or a real-life photo. You can search on Google image or download it from some discord profile sites.</p><p>Next, you need to load the selected image into a new project, and then resize the image to fit the preferred dimensions for Discord and change its shape to circular. To change the shape, go to Effects -&gt; Utility -&gt; Image Mask to optimize the image for a Discord avatar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-overlay-image-mask-discord-profile-wondershare-filmora.jpg"                      alt="create discord avatar with Filmora"                ></p><p>By adding overlays on top of the basic image, you can also introduce any visual or textual elements that will personalize the avatar even further. To get maximum attention, you might want to use a video or animation as part of the avatar – just add them to overlays and save your file as GIF. Since Discord allows GIF format, you can get an avatar that literally jumps off the page in every chat that you are a part of and elicits a strong reaction from those who see it.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Change-My-Profile-Picture-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Change-My-Profile-Picture-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?</h2><p>After you successfully created a profile image that you are completely satisfied with, it’s time to upload it to Discord and start using it as your avatar in all your chats. However, this is not done in the same way on different platforms, so you will need to follow the instructions for the type of system you normally use to access your Discord account.</p><h3 id="How-to-Change-Avatars-on-Discord-Desktop-Computer"><a href="#How-to-Change-Avatars-on-Discord-Desktop-Computer" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Avatars on Discord Desktop Computer?"></a>How to Change Avatars on Discord Desktop Computer?</h3><p>Open your Discord app (Mac or Windows version) and look for a gear icon in the bottom left corner of your screen. Clicking on this icon will take you to the User settings menu, where you need to find the My Account tab.</p><p>Next, hover with your mouse cursor over the current profile picture, then click on the icon that appears right next to it. This action will let you upload an image (JPG or GIF) from your hard drive and make it your new profile picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-discord-profile-avatar.jpg"                      alt="change discord avatar"                ></p><p>Keep in mind that Discord will automatically crop images that are not already in a circular format, so you need to make sure that the image is well centered before uploading.</p><h3 id="How-to-Change-Discord-Avatars-on-Mobile-Devices"><a href="#How-to-Change-Discord-Avatars-on-Mobile-Devices" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Discord Avatars on Mobile Devices?"></a>How to Change Discord Avatars on Mobile Devices?</h3><p>The procedure for changing the profile avatar on Discord from a mobile device is equally straightforward, and it’s similar on both Android and iOS phones. After you open the app, you need to tap on the icon in the right bottom corner to access the Account menu.</p><p>Find the profile picture in the screen that opens, and tap on it to access your phone gallery, then choose the image you would like to use for identification on Discord. It will automatically be uploaded and replace the current image as your only avatar on all Discord channels until it’s changed again.</p><h2 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Profile-Pictures-on-Discord"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Profile-Pictures-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Frequently Asked Questions About Profile Pictures on Discord"></a>Frequently Asked Questions About Profile Pictures on Discord</h2><h4 id="1-Why-can’t-I-change-my-profile-picture-on-Discord"><a href="#1-Why-can’t-I-change-my-profile-picture-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="1. Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?"></a>1. Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?</h4><p>If you experience this problem, it’s most likely a consequence of trying to make too many picture changes too fast. While Discord will allow you to upload two profile images in rapid succession, the third attempt within a few minutes is going to be unsuccessful. The problem will disappear if you wait for a short period of time and try uploading again. Another reason might be that your firewall is preventing you from using an image from a cloud server, but you can easily bypass the issue and download the picture first to your hard disc before uploading it to Discord from there.</p><h4 id="2-How-can-I-find-my-old-profile-picture"><a href="#2-How-can-I-find-my-old-profile-picture" class="headerlink" title="2. How can I find my old profile picture?"></a>2. How can I find my old profile picture?</h4><p>All of the images you previously used as Discord avatars remain memorized and can be reactivated at any time. You can find this collection of images on a specific portion of your profile page, so if you want to use any of them you can simply click on them without having to go through the regular upload process all over again.</p><h4 id="3-What-do-the-colored-dots-next-to-my-profile-picture-mean"><a href="#3-What-do-the-colored-dots-next-to-my-profile-picture-mean" class="headerlink" title="3. What do the colored dots next to my profile picture mean?"></a>3. What do the colored dots next to my profile picture mean?</h4><p>Those dots indicate the current status of the user, with each color having a fixed meaning. If you see a green dot, the user is available to chat at the moment. A yellow dot indicated an idle user that hasn’t been active in a while, and the red color means the user is busy and doesn’t want to be disturbed. Finally, a gray dot confirms that the user is currently not signed in to his Discord account.</p><h4 id="4-Can-I-use-different-avatars-on-different-Discord-servers"><a href="#4-Can-I-use-different-avatars-on-different-Discord-servers" class="headerlink" title="4.

Pasting the URL into your browser will open the image and allow you to save it as you would do with any other picture from the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/top-discount-emblem-artist-tools-now-available-free-for-2024/"><u>Top Discount Emblem Artist Tools - Now Available FREE for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-leading-logos-for-linked-worldwide-web/"><u>2024 Approved  Leading Logos for Linked Worldwide Web</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-learn-to-craft-striking-pfps-on-discord-with-ease/"><u>2024 Approved  Learn to Craft Striking Pfps on Discord with Ease</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-20-emojis-designer-tools-on-discord/"><u>2024 Approved  Top 20 Emojis Designer Tools on Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-discord-color-coding-techniques/"><u>2024 Approved  Mastering Discord Color Coding Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-inside-top-15-emotes-a-look-at-the-masters-of-creation/"><u>[New] Inside Top 15 Emotes  A Look at the Masters of Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-premiere-online-screen-recording-apps-discord-edition/"><u>[New] In 2024, Premiere Online Screen Recording Apps  Discord Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-broadcasting-with-a-history-live-transmission-of-pre-recorded-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Broadcasting with a History  LIVE Transmission of Pre-Recorded Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-from-subdued-to-striking-the-art-of-post-color-correction/"><u>In 2024, From Subdued to Striking  The Art of Post-Color Correction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-full-screen-mastery-for-premier-pro-users/"><u>2024 Approved  Full Screen Mastery for Premier Pro Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-uniting-visuals-on-iphone-photos-with-videos/"><u>[Updated] Uniting Visuals on iPhone  Photos with Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-12-mini-without-passcode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock iPhone 12 mini Without Passcode? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-decoding-youtubes-operations-following-uploads/"><u>[New] Decoding YouTube’s Operations Following Uploads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/in-2024-youtube-lives-are-very-popular-nowadays-and-people-can-interact-with-the-anchor-at-real-time-if-you-want-to-comment-on-a-youtube-live-chat-you-can-f/"><u>In 2024, YouTube Lives Are Very Popular Nowadays and People Can Interact with the Anchor at Real Time.

And unlike other apps, Discord does not allow users to mass-delete their message history. For some, that can sound like a nightmare because of privacy and security reasons. You will have to wade through every message, deleting each of them, one by one.</p><p>However, if you find yourself in that position, fret not because there are several solutions to help you get around this limitation. Unfortunately, none of them are perfect.</p><p>Since there is no official method of mass deleting messages, these workarounds are shoddy, but until Discord offers an official solution, we’ll have to do with them.</p><p>If you’re looking to mass-delete your messages from a server or channel on Discord, here’s how you will go about it for the desktop and mobile versions:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: How to Delete Direct Messages on Discord</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Deleting Channel Messages in Discord</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part 4: Deleting Messages with Discord Clear Chat Bot</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part5"><strong>Part 5: Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-Discord-Message-Types"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-Discord-Message-Types" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types"></a>Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types</h2><p>In Discord, you will see two types of messages: Direct Messages and Channel Messages in servers. Here are the differences between the two:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct Messages</strong>: These messages are private and held between two users</li><li><strong>Channel Messages</strong>: These messages are sent in a channel or a specific group</li></ul><p>Both of these message types abide by different rules and functions. In the early days of Discord, users had the luxury of deleting messages in bulk.</p><p>However, this was soon changed because the mass execution directly affected the app’s database. Since then, the application has adopted specific rules regarding message deletion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

If you don’t want to show messages from a particular friend, you can remove the chat copy, and it will disappear from the messages temporarily, although it will still be visible in the recipient’s chats. And if the friend contacts you again, the messages will show.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-discord-copy.jpg"                      alt="Remove Discord Direct Message Copy"                ></p><p>You can delete the local copy of messages by following the steps below:</p><ol><li>Open the Discord program on your computer and go to the chat panel of the person whom you direct messaged;</li><li>Tap on the ‘Message’ option on the left side, and then select the ‘Direct Message’ option on the top left side;</li><li>Select the message that you want to delete and click the 3 dots to click on Delete Message, then the message you sent will be deleted at your end.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-discord-direct-message.jpg"                      alt="delete Discord Message"                ></p><p>The procedure for deleting DMs from your Discord smartphone application applies for both the Android and IOS application, and it is as follows:</p><ol><li>Open the Discord app on your smartphone</li><li>Find the message that you want to delete</li><li>Tap and hold the message. You will be presented with a list</li><li>Tap ‘Delete’ on that list</li><li>Confirm your decision by tapping ‘Delete’ once again</li><li>The message will be deleted</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Delete-Channel-Messages-in-Discord"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Delete-Channel-Messages-in-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Delete Channel Messages in Discord?"></a>Part 3: How to Delete Channel Messages in Discord?</h2><p>This method has to be the most effective and easy way to delete a Discord message, and it’s a simple, straightforward procedure:</p><ol><li>Go to the message and glide over it to reveal the three-tier settings icon</li><li>Click on it to show options, and then select Delete Message</li></ol><p>To do this individually, you will need to use the mouse consistently, eating up a lot of time. If you wish to do it by keyboard, you can do so, provided you know the sequence for the keyboard commands for deletion.</p><p>Here is a more detailed breakdown of the sequence:</p><ol><li>Select the Chat panel that you want to delete</li><li>Hover your cursor over the messages you wish to delete</li><li>A three-dot icon will appear on the right side of the message</li><li>Click on the icon, and a pop-menu will show</li><li>On the pop-up menu, select ‘Delete’</li><li>You will be prompted with a confirmation for deleting the message</li><li>Tick the confirmation and tap the ‘Delete’ button</li><li>Your message will be deleted</li></ol><p>At first glance, it seems like a long and tedious process, but once you get down to doing it and develop a rhythm, it is an easy task.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Deleting-Message-with-Discord-Clear-Chat-Bot"><a href="#Part-4-Deleting-Message-with-Discord-Clear-Chat-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Deleting Message with Discord Clear Chat Bot"></a>Part 4: Deleting Message with Discord Clear Chat Bot</h2><p>Please keep in mind that Discord has changed its policy regarding bots, going from discouraging their use to outright flagging them as a violation of its terms.</p><p>Using bots can put you at risk of termination from the app, so we would not advise you to adopt this method, and if you do, please tread with caution.</p><p>With that said, many users report that using self-bots does not significantly lead to any disciplinary action from Discord, given that the reason for use is not harmful or disruptive.</p><p>Discord requires that all bots are tracked through its ‘Develop Portal.’ Self-bots run on a Discord API token and can circumvent this rule, allowing them access to API requests hence automating many tasks, such as deleting messages.</p><p>The Discord API supports a POST request, letting bots swiftly discard messages less than fourteen days old. Messages that are older than this timeframe can be queued and discarded one-by-one.</p><p>One particular bot that is of interest to us is the MEE6. It is used to control moderation, set-up leveling, manage music, and much more, including mass-deleting messages on Discord.</p><p>We’ve outlined a few commands you can use to delete your chats. These are as follows:</p><ol><li>Go to the official MEE6 website and click on the button that says Add to Discord</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-bot-mee6.jpg"                      alt="delete messages on discord with mee6 bot"                ></p><ol><li>You’ll be prompted to authorize so that MEE6 bot can access your username, and know what server you’re in.</li><li>Pin-point the server you want to add the bot and then set up to connect MEE6 to the Discord server.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-server-to-add-mee6-bot-discord.jpg"                      alt="how to delete discord message with mee6 bot"                ></p><ol><li>Click Authorize again and the bot will be added to your Discord server soon;</li><li>To enable MEE6 to clear the chat, you should enable the Moderator plugin first. Click the Moderator option under Plugins first, and then click Yes.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mee6-moderator-plugin-moderator.jpg"                      alt="remove discord message with mee 6"                ></p><ol><li>Now go to the server in your Discord and type in “!clear @username” to remove every message sent by the user you’ve mentioned.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-channel-message-in-bulk-mee6-discord.jpg"                      alt="delete discord channel message with MEE6 Bot"                ></p><p>To clear the last 100 messages on your server, type in “!clear 100”. You can replace 100 with any number of your choice. However, MEE6 can’t delete messages past 2 weeks.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Clear-All-Chats-and-Delete-All-Messages-In-Discord"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Clear-All-Chats-and-Delete-All-Messages-In-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord?"></a>Part 5: How to Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord?</h2><p>In the section above, we talked about deleting messages without using the mouse. That leads us to the possibility of utilizing the ‘AutoHotkey’ script to automate the process.</p><p>Most developers have come up with codes that can delete Discord messages from your account on a mass scale. We’ll be expanding on one of the most popular instances of this: the AutoHotkey script.</p><p>Before you get started with this, you will need an ‘AutoHotkey installer.’ Continue the process by:</p><ol><li>Download and install the ‘AutoHotkey installer’ ;</li><li>Head onto your desktop, right-click and click ‘New’ on the drop-down menu;</li><li>Choose the ‘AutoHotkey script’ and right-click on this file and edit with ‘Notepad’</li><li>Delete everything in the script and paste the following code</li></ol><p><strong><em>t::</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Loop, 100000</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>{</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Up}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, ^a</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {BS}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Enter}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Enter}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>sleep, 100</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Return</em></strong></p><ol><li>Save the file as any name that you wish to</li><li>Once you’ve done that, launch Discord and double-click on the script file</li><li>Open the chat data that you wish to delete and press T</li><li>The script will now delete all the messages</li></ol><p>To stop the script, click on the H icon located on the right side of your taskbar and select Pause Script.</p><p>This is the process by which you can use an ‘Autohotkey script’ to delete messages in bulk.

And unlike other apps, Discord does not allow users to mass-delete their message history. For some, that can sound like a nightmare because of privacy and security reasons. You will have to wade through every message, deleting each of them, one by one.</p><p>However, if you find yourself in that position, fret not because there are several solutions to help you get around this limitation. Unfortunately, none of them are perfect.</p><p>Since there is no official method of mass deleting messages, these workarounds are shoddy, but until Discord offers an official solution, we’ll have to do with them.</p><p>If you’re looking to mass-delete your messages from a server or channel on Discord, here’s how you will go about it for the desktop and mobile versions:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: How to Delete Direct Messages on Discord</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Deleting Channel Messages in Discord</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part 4: Deleting Messages with Discord Clear Chat Bot</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part5"><strong>Part 5: Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-Discord-Message-Types"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-Discord-Message-Types" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types"></a>Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types</h2><p>In Discord, you will see two types of messages: Direct Messages and Channel Messages in servers. Here are the differences between the two:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct Messages</strong>: These messages are private and held between two users</li><li><strong>Channel Messages</strong>: These messages are sent in a channel or a specific group</li></ul><p>Both of these message types abide by different rules and functions. In the early days of Discord, users had the luxury of deleting messages in bulk.</p><p>However, this was soon changed because the mass execution directly affected the app’s database. Since then, the application has adopted specific rules regarding message deletion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

If you don’t want to show messages from a particular friend, you can remove the chat copy, and it will disappear from the messages temporarily, although it will still be visible in the recipient’s chats. And if the friend contacts you again, the messages will show.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-discord-copy.jpg"                      alt="Remove Discord Direct Message Copy"                ></p><p>You can delete the local copy of messages by following the steps below:</p><ol><li>Open the Discord program on your computer and go to the chat panel of the person whom you direct messaged;</li><li>Tap on the ‘Message’ option on the left side, and then select the ‘Direct Message’ option on the top left side;</li><li>Select the message that you want to delete and click the 3 dots to click on Delete Message, then the message you sent will be deleted at your end.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-discord-direct-message.jpg"                      alt="delete Discord Message"                ></p><p>The procedure for deleting DMs from your Discord smartphone application applies for both the Android and IOS application, and it is as follows:</p><ol><li>Open the Discord app on your smartphone</li><li>Find the message that you want to delete</li><li>Tap and hold the message. You will be presented with a list</li><li>Tap ‘Delete’ on that list</li><li>Confirm your decision by tapping ‘Delete’ once again</li><li>The message will be deleted</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Delete-Channel-Messages-in-Discord"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Delete-Channel-Messages-in-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Delete Channel Messages in Discord?"></a>Part 3: How to Delete Channel Messages in Discord?</h2><p>This method has to be the most effective and easy way to delete a Discord message, and it’s a simple, straightforward procedure:</p><ol><li>Go to the message and glide over it to reveal the three-tier settings icon</li><li>Click on it to show options, and then select Delete Message</li></ol><p>To do this individually, you will need to use the mouse consistently, eating up a lot of time. If you wish to do it by keyboard, you can do so, provided you know the sequence for the keyboard commands for deletion.</p><p>Here is a more detailed breakdown of the sequence:</p><ol><li>Select the Chat panel that you want to delete</li><li>Hover your cursor over the messages you wish to delete</li><li>A three-dot icon will appear on the right side of the message</li><li>Click on the icon, and a pop-menu will show</li><li>On the pop-up menu, select ‘Delete’</li><li>You will be prompted with a confirmation for deleting the message</li><li>Tick the confirmation and tap the ‘Delete’ button</li><li>Your message will be deleted</li></ol><p>At first glance, it seems like a long and tedious process, but once you get down to doing it and develop a rhythm, it is an easy task.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Deleting-Message-with-Discord-Clear-Chat-Bot"><a href="#Part-4-Deleting-Message-with-Discord-Clear-Chat-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Deleting Message with Discord Clear Chat Bot"></a>Part 4: Deleting Message with Discord Clear Chat Bot</h2><p>Please keep in mind that Discord has changed its policy regarding bots, going from discouraging their use to outright flagging them as a violation of its terms.</p><p>Using bots can put you at risk of termination from the app, so we would not advise you to adopt this method, and if you do, please tread with caution.</p><p>With that said, many users report that using self-bots does not significantly lead to any disciplinary action from Discord, given that the reason for use is not harmful or disruptive.</p><p>Discord requires that all bots are tracked through its ‘Develop Portal.’ Self-bots run on a Discord API token and can circumvent this rule, allowing them access to API requests hence automating many tasks, such as deleting messages.</p><p>The Discord API supports a POST request, letting bots swiftly discard messages less than fourteen days old. Messages that are older than this timeframe can be queued and discarded one-by-one.</p><p>One particular bot that is of interest to us is the MEE6. It is used to control moderation, set-up leveling, manage music, and much more, including mass-deleting messages on Discord.</p><p>We’ve outlined a few commands you can use to delete your chats. These are as follows:</p><ol><li>Go to the official MEE6 website and click on the button that says Add to Discord</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-bot-mee6.jpg"                      alt="delete messages on discord with mee6 bot"                ></p><ol><li>You’ll be prompted to authorize so that MEE6 bot can access your username, and know what server you’re in.</li><li>Pin-point the server you want to add the bot and then set up to connect MEE6 to the Discord server.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-server-to-add-mee6-bot-discord.jpg"                      alt="how to delete discord message with mee6 bot"                ></p><ol><li>Click Authorize again and the bot will be added to your Discord server soon;</li><li>To enable MEE6 to clear the chat, you should enable the Moderator plugin first. Click the Moderator option under Plugins first, and then click Yes.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mee6-moderator-plugin-moderator.jpg"                      alt="remove discord message with mee 6"                ></p><ol><li>Now go to the server in your Discord and type in “!clear @username” to remove every message sent by the user you’ve mentioned.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-channel-message-in-bulk-mee6-discord.jpg"                      alt="delete discord channel message with MEE6 Bot"                ></p><p>To clear the last 100 messages on your server, type in “!clear 100”. You can replace 100 with any number of your choice. However, MEE6 can’t delete messages past 2 weeks.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Clear-All-Chats-and-Delete-All-Messages-In-Discord"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Clear-All-Chats-and-Delete-All-Messages-In-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord?"></a>Part 5: How to Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord?</h2><p>In the section above, we talked about deleting messages without using the mouse. That leads us to the possibility of utilizing the ‘AutoHotkey’ script to automate the process.</p><p>Most developers have come up with codes that can delete Discord messages from your account on a mass scale. We’ll be expanding on one of the most popular instances of this: the AutoHotkey script.</p><p>Before you get started with this, you will need an ‘AutoHotkey installer.’ Continue the process by:</p><ol><li>Download and install the ‘AutoHotkey installer’ ;</li><li>Head onto your desktop, right-click and click ‘New’ on the drop-down menu;</li><li>Choose the ‘AutoHotkey script’ and right-click on this file and edit with ‘Notepad’</li><li>Delete everything in the script and paste the following code</li></ol><p><strong><em>t::</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Loop, 100000</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>{</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Up}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, ^a</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {BS}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Enter}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Enter}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>sleep, 100</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Return</em></strong></p><ol><li>Save the file as any name that you wish to</li><li>Once you’ve done that, launch Discord and double-click on the script file</li><li>Open the chat data that you wish to delete and press T</li><li>The script will now delete all the messages</li></ol><p>To stop the script, click on the H icon located on the right side of your taskbar and select Pause Script.</p><p>This is the process by which you can use an ‘Autohotkey script’ to delete messages in bulk. Please note that this option is only available to Windows users as AutoHotkey does not currently work on macOS.</p><p>Ideally, you’ll want the following things from your AutoHotkey script:</p><ol><li>A toggle key for turning it on and off</li><li>The complete keyboard sequence with stops between each step</li></ol><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: you can delete a message you sent, but there’s no saying if the other person took a screenshot before you got around to deleting it. Things on the internet tend to stick around. So, as a safe bet, it’s a good idea to take some time to consider what you wrote before pressing send to avoid any regrets.</p><h4 id="You-May-Also-Interested-In"><a href="#You-May-Also-Interested-In" class="headerlink" title="You May Also Interested In"></a>You May Also Interested In</h4><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Discord Font Generators [Online&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;Android] <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Discord Emoji Makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10+ Best Free Discord Voice Changers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="FAQs-About-Deleting-Discord-Messages"><a href="#FAQs-About-Deleting-Discord-Messages" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Deleting Discord Messages"></a>FAQs About Deleting Discord Messages</h2><h4 id="1-Can-I-Recover-A-Deleted-Message-on-Discord"><a href="#1-Can-I-Recover-A-Deleted-Message-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="1.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Skype-or-Discord-Finding-Your-Ideal-Chat-App"><a href="#Skype-or-Discord-Finding-Your-Ideal-Chat-App" class="headerlink" title="Skype or Discord: Finding Your Ideal Chat App"></a>Skype or Discord: Finding Your Ideal Chat App</h2><h1 id="Discord-Vs-Skype-Which-One-is-Better-For-You"><a href="#Discord-Vs-Skype-Which-One-is-Better-For-You" class="headerlink" title="Discord Vs. Skype: Which One is Better For You?"></a>Discord Vs. Skype: Which One is Better For You?</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett"><a href="#Richard-Bennett" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>What would be a catchy but concise way to describe Discord? A modern voice and text communication app that’s free.</p><p>It’s also wildly popular with gamers, secure with DDoS protection, and compatible with desktops as well as mobiles.</p><p>And what if you had to describe Skype in a similar manner? An all-in-one app for voice calls, messaging, video conferencing, and file transfer that allows you to connect with others no matter where you are.</p><p>Employees need to rely on VoIP apps like Skype and Discord to maintain communication with their colleagues and clients.</p><p>You might be wondering which is the better option among the two? Is Skype better than Discord, given that it’s more popular and been around for longer?</p><p>Or is Discord more secure than Skype? Both these apps have different backgrounds and target different audiences. While Discord is more popular with gamers, Skype is readily used in offices.</p><p>Yet, at the same time, both offer similar sets of features that most users require from VoIP apps. So, let’s get into discussing which VoIP app is better: Skype or Discord?</p><h2 id="Which-Platform-Is-Better-Discord-or-Skype"><a href="#Which-Platform-Is-Better-Discord-or-Skype" class="headerlink" title="Which Platform Is Better: Discord or Skype?"></a>Which Platform Is Better: Discord or Skype?</h2><p>Our criteria will consider some aspects that are important when discussing communication platforms.</p><p>These include Privacy, Security, Sound Quality, Group Calls, Screen Sharing, Call Recording, File Sharing, The Interface, Supported platforms.</p><h3 id="1-Privacy"><a href="#1-Privacy" class="headerlink" title="1. Privacy"></a>1. Privacy</h3><p>Both Skype and Discord can be classified as VoIP apps because of their similar functionalities. However, there are also many differences in their features and who they cater to.</p><p>But when considering privacy, both apps seemed to be lacking.</p><p>Unfortunately, there have been reports of data breaches from both apps, with users complaining of having their locations and personal data compromised and leaked.</p><p>Neither of these apps promises complete privacy, and our recommendation would be to use them in combination with a reliable VPN service.</p><h3 id="2-Security"><a href="#2-Security" class="headerlink" title="2. Security"></a>2. Security</h3><p>Discord offers its users both DDoS and IP address protection, offering full client-to-server security.</p><p>On the other hand, Skype was rated poorly for its security but has recently upgraded its measures, hiding user’s IP addresses.</p><h3 id="3-Sound-Quality"><a href="#3-Sound-Quality" class="headerlink" title="3. Sound Quality"></a>3. Sound Quality</h3><p>Discord differs from Skype in its audio-transmission methods and data usage. Skype works much like a phone connection, transmitting audio data continuously, like a phone call. In contrast, Discord only sends audio data when a user speaks during a call.</p><p>Both apps differ in their recommended bandwidth, with Skype having an extensive bandwidth of 100 kbps for voice calls and Discord with only 64 kbps in comparison.</p><p>For this reason, we would rank Skype higher than Discord for sound quality and audio transmission.</p><h3 id="4-Group-Calls"><a href="#4-Group-Calls" class="headerlink" title="4. Group Calls"></a>4. Group Calls</h3><p>When comparing the two for group calls, Skype trumps Discord as the better and more widely popular option.</p><p>With Skype, users can make group audio and video calls, with as many as 25 people at the same time. On the other hand, Discord limits the number of users who can join a group call to just 10.</p><p>Also, Skype allows users to make calls on other phone numbers, including landlines, while Discord only limits calls to other Discord users.</p><p>Overall, Skype comes through as a much better choice for group calling.</p><h3 id="5-Screen-Sharing"><a href="#5-Screen-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="5. Screen Sharing"></a>5. Screen Sharing</h3><p>In this age of remote working, the need for screen-sharing has increased drastically to enhance professional collaboration.</p><p>In this regard, both Discord and Skype offer a decent screen-sharing experience.</p><p>With Skype, users can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >share their screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> even during audio calls, and it is relatively easy to do so, requiring only a single click to start screen-sharing. Plus, it allows users to take a simple screenshot as well.</p><p>In comparison, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Discord offers screen-sharing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> options that are more customizable and thorough, with more features for users to benefit from, such as fragmented sharing for people who don’t want to share their full screen.</p><p>When comparing the two, Discord offers more customization, while Skype offers simple features but is more dependable and convenient. Therefore, Discord edges Skype out by a slight margin for its customizable features.</p><h3 id="6-Call-Recording"><a href="#6-Call-Recording" class="headerlink" title="6. Call Recording"></a>6. Call Recording</h3><p>Skype has a definitive advantage over Discord in this department, as there is no in-built audio or video recording feature or option in Discord.</p><p>Users cannot record calls on Discord, while <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Skype does grant a call recording <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> option for both video and audio calls.</p><p>It must be noted that the call recording feature in Skype is a recent addition, after frequent customer complaints about the lack of any call recording option.</p><p>It is also relatively simple to do so on Skype; click on the “+” icon and tap on “Start Recording.” This procedure works for both the desktop and mobile versions of Skype.</p><p>However, Discord users do not need to despair, as there is a way out for their call recording woes:</p><p>They can record calls by <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >installing third-party apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>; however, there have been controversies regarding data breaches through third-party apps, so we’d advise treading with caution.</p><h3 id="7-File-Sharing"><a href="#7-File-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="7. File Sharing"></a>7. File Sharing</h3><p>Both Discord and Skype allow their users to share multiple files with unlimited users; however, they seem to differ in the file volume that can be shared.</p><p>For Skype users, this limit is restricted to files up to 300MB. If the file volume exceeds this limit, the users will be redirected to OneDrive to share with as many users as they want.</p><p>Compared to Skype, Discord’s file volume limit varies, depending on free users and Nitro users. The file limit for free users is a rather mediocre 8MB, while Nitro users have an ample limit of 50MB.</p><p>The monthly subscription for Nitro costs $4.99, so if you’re looking for free options, Skype takes the win here.</p><p>When considered objectively, the Discord free version is somewhat limiting, and users will need to move onto Discord Nitro if they wish to post pictures or videos.</p><p>However, Discord does offer its users external cloud storage platforms. These storage platforms require bots to create shortcuts when exceeding the sharing limit and can be rather tedious. Overall, Skype seems to take the lead in file sharing.</p><h3 id="8-The-Interface"><a href="#8-The-Interface" class="headerlink" title="8. The Interface"></a>8. The Interface</h3><p>Both Skype and Discord have different interfaces, with Skype following a minimalistic layout and interface from its inception.</p><p>Since then, it has incorporated new updates and additions to account for new features that boost the user experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-interface.jpg"                      alt="Skype Interface"                ></p><p>Skype has traditionally been considered a business tool, ideal for making landline and international calls, with perfect compatibility with most business apps.</p><p>On the other hand, Discord is not as easy to use as Skype because of its more complex layout.</p><p>Discord, unlike Skype, is much more than a VoIP app. The gaming community relies on it to stream gaming sessions; online fan clubs also use it to share content among their communities.</p><p>Instead of just an app used to make calls, Discords presents itself as a forum for peers to hang out online.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg"                      alt="Discord Interface"                ></p><p>Additionally, due to its tilt towards the gaming community, Discord includes a unique feature, where each time a user makes a call, they are assigned a server. Other users can join this server without the original users having to leave their game.</p><p>This way, gamers can display their gaming skills to others in real-time. These calls are called drop-in calls and require no invites, meaning you can chat with anyone without them being your friend inside a server.</p><p>Due to its enhanced useability, Discord wins this category!</p><h3 id="9-Supported-Platforms"><a href="#9-Supported-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="9. Supported Platforms"></a>9. Supported Platforms</h3><p>In this regard, Discord wins over Skype with a considerable lead. Discord allows users to sync with Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Steam, and many other apps, making it easy to find friends and families and connect with them.</p><p>It even allows you to check what music your friends are listening to on Spotify!</p><p>In contrast, Skype is considerably limited as it only syncs with Facebook. However, its value lies in its compatibility with business apps, notably Docs, Excel, and Powerpoint, as well as polls and whiteboard.</p><p>Recently, you will find Skype Business to be included in the Office 365 Suite, costing $8.99 as a whole.</p><h2 id="Skype-Vs-Discord-Which-One-Should-You-Choose"><a href="#Skype-Vs-Discord-Which-One-Should-You-Choose" class="headerlink" title="Skype Vs. Discord: Which One Should You Choose?"></a>Skype Vs. Discord: Which One Should You Choose?</h2><p>These apps deliver much of the essential features that users expect from top VoIP apps, yet they cater to different sets of users.</p><p>While Skype allows you to make mobile and landline calls by buying credit online, Discord limits itself to only app-to-app communications.</p><p>Skype also offers bots that can be found using the search option. These bots include games and music bots, but compared to Discord, they’re somewhat limited.</p><p>Discord’s bots keep in spirit with its gaming audience and include a diverse range of features, including some that allow you to play games, play music or create memes.</p><p>In contrast, Skype is considerably business-oriented, allowing you to host large meetings with 250 participants.</p><p>All in all, both of these apps offer unique features for their intended audiences. How useful you find each app depends on the category you belong to.</p><p>If you’re a gamer who likes to connect with other gamers or stream videos, Discord is the choice for you. However, if you are a business professional looking to host video conferences, Skype is the better option.</p><p>In case that you want to record the desktop screen and the audio simultaneously, you should try Wondershare Filmora, which provides both the recording and editing tools.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload

You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.</p><p>Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.</p><p>One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Best Screen Recorder Software for Discord Desktop App</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord"></a>Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.</p><h3 id="1-OBS"><a href="#1-OBS" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS"></a>1. OBS</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.</p><p>There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.</p><h3 id="2-Bandicam"><a href="#2-Bandicam" class="headerlink" title="2. Bandicam"></a>2. Bandicam</h3><p>Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.</p><p>Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn’t involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.</p><h3 id="3-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#3-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="3. Wondershare Filmora"></a>3. Wondershare Filmora</h3><p>Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><h3 id="4-DemoCreator"><a href="#4-DemoCreator" class="headerlink" title="4. DemoCreator"></a>4. DemoCreator</h3><p>If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/" >Wondershare DemoCreator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.</p><p>You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.</p><h3 id="5-Camtasia"><a href="#5-Camtasia" class="headerlink" title="5. Camtasia"></a>5. Camtasia</h3><p>If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then <a class="link"   href="https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html" >Camtasia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.</p><p>However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord"></a>Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</h2><p>If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.</p><h3 id="2-Screen-Capture"><a href="#2-Screen-Capture" class="headerlink" title="2. Screen Capture"></a>2. Screen Capture</h3><p>One such option is <a class="link"   href="https://www.screencapture.com/" >Screen Capture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.</p><p>There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.</p><h3 id="3-Clipchamp"><a href="#3-Clipchamp" class="headerlink" title="3. Clipchamp"></a>3. Clipchamp</h3><p>If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer <a class="link"   href="https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/" >Clipchamp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.</p><p>It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.</p><h3 id="3-Screencast-o-matic"><a href="#3-Screencast-o-matic" class="headerlink" title="3. Screencast-o-matic"></a>3. Screencast-o-matic</h3><p>The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is <a class="link"   href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder" >Screencast-o-matic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.</p><p>The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android"><a href="#Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android"></a>Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.</p><h3 id="1-AZ-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#1-AZ-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="1. AZ Screen Recorder"></a>1. AZ Screen Recorder</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >AZ Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.</p><p>It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.</p><h3 id="2-Screen-Recorder-for-Game-Video-Call-Screenshots"><a href="#2-Screen-Recorder-for-Game-Video-Call-Screenshots" class="headerlink" title="2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots"></a>2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots</h3><p>Another option for Android is <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.</p><p>The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.</p><h3 id="3-Record-It"><a href="#3-Record-It" class="headerlink" title="3. Record It"></a>3. Record It</h3><p>If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545" >Record It! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.</p><p>The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Record-Discord-Video-Screen-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Record-Discord-Video-Screen-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</h2><p>If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.</p><p>Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.</p><p>You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.</p><p>If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.</p><p>Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.</p><p>The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-enhancing-your-digital-persona-personalize-your-discord-status-with-custom-emojis/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Enhancing Your Digital Persona  Personalize Your Discord Status with Custom Emojis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-top-free-designer-for-discord-emblems-download-links-included-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Top Free Designer for Discord Emblems - Download Links Included for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-boost-your-discord-experience-with-these-30-bots/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Boost Your Discord Experience with These 30 Bots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-journey-towards-authenticity-a-guide-to-verified-discord-affiliation/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Journey Towards Authenticity  A Guide to Verified Discord Affiliation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-exploring-discord-nitro-vip-access-and-the-steps-for-obtainment/"><u>In 2024, Exploring Discord Nitro  VIP Access & The Steps for Obtainment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-tight-knit-teams-top-chat-platforms-which-rules-the-game-slack-or-discord/"><u>In 2024, Tight-Knit Teams, Top Chat Platforms  Which Rules the Game - Slack or Discord?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-finding-the-perfect-voip-service-discord-vs-skype-dilemma/"><u>[Updated] Finding the Perfect VoIP Service  Discord Vs Skype Dilemma</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-charting-your-course-to-certification-a-guide-to-verified-partnership/"><u>2024 Approved  Charting Your Course to Certification  A Guide to Verified Partnership</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/unmasking-the-innovators-who-revolutionized-discord-chat-for-2024/"><u>Unmasking the Innovators Who Revolutionized Discord Chat for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-elevate-your-discord-statues-with-fun-emoji-add-ons/"><u>[New] In 2024, Elevate Your Discord Statues with Fun Emoji Add-Ons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-tips-and-tricks-for-setting-up-your-samsung-galaxy-a14-4g-phone-pattern-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Tips and Tricks for Setting Up your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G Phone Pattern Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-united-experts-easeus-expert-reviews/"><u>In 2024, United Experts  EaseUS Expert Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/my-videos-arent-playing-on-lava-yuva-3-what-can-i-do-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>My Videos Arent Playing on Lava Yuva 3 – What Can I Do?

All you need to do is find the video you want to keep and right-click on it, then click on the arrow icon in the upper right corner (in-app).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-discord-video.jpg"                      alt="download videos  on Discord"                ></p><p>This simple action will send the video directly to your computer hard drive, although you might have to wait a little bit until the transfer is completed.</p><p>The time needed for the download depends on the size of the video as well as the speed of your internet. After the download, you will be able to find the file in the default folder that you use for all online downloads, and you can play it from there or move it to a more permanent location, i.e. collection of funny videos.</p><p>As you can see, downloading discord videos to your desktop is extremely simple and straightforward regardless of how the video was created. Whether you are using a Discord Web or on Windows or Mac desktop, there is no need to use a Discord video downloader.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-Videos-of-Mobile-Android-and-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-Videos-of-Mobile-Android-and-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Download Videos of Mobile (Android and iPhone)"></a>Part 2: How to Download Videos of Mobile (Android and iPhone)</h2><p>For users who log on to discord from a mobile phone, the procedure of downloading a video can be a bit more complicated than when using a PC.</p><p>First of all, the type of the operating system plays a role, so you need to pay attention to whether you are using Discord on Android or iOS.</p><p>Next, you need to check whether the video was posted through a third-party app such as YouTube for example. If it is, you need to follow the link and download the video from the original platform that is hosting it. You can check these <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video downloader app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you may need.</p><p>Another possibility is to simply play the video and use a recording app to make a copy on your phone. Simply select a screen capture app on your iPhone or Android phones, play the video and start recording! Once you complete the recording, the video that looks identical to the original file you played on Discord will be saved to your device, allowing you to use it as you desire or share it with others on other platforms.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Download-Videos-from-Discord-Via-Bots"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Download-Videos-from-Discord-Via-Bots" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Download Videos from Discord Via Bots?"></a>Part 3: How to Download Videos from Discord Via Bots?</h2><p>Discord Bots are automated modules that can be tasked with many different functions, and they represent a great way to customize your experience on this platform. They can be readily created from scratch or acquired from other users in already functional form.</p><p>While creating a new Bot specifically for video downloads can be demanding in terms of software development knowledge, there are a large number of various bots that can be used for this purpose and most of them are free to use! Discord Downloader Go made by get-got would be a nice try. Here is where you can get it: <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/get-got/discord-downloader-go" >https://github.com/get-got/discord-downloader-go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Before you try this option, try to read the detailed specification of the Bot and check whether it’s well suited for the type of action you need to perform (i.e. downloading embedded YouTube videos). If you do some research, it’s very likely that you will find a Bot that serves exactly the function you had in mind.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Discord-Video-Download"><a href="#Part-4-Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Discord-Video-Download" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions About Discord Video Download"></a>Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions About Discord Video Download</h2><p>Users also want to know about some other details related to multimedia downloads from the Discord platforms. We provided some answers to the most common dilemmas that new Discord members are struggling with:</p><h4 id="Is-It-Safe-to-Download-Files-from-Discord"><a href="#Is-It-Safe-to-Download-Files-from-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Is It Safe to Download Files from Discord?"></a>Is It Safe to Download Files from Discord?</h4><p>The question of security should always be taken seriously, so it’s reasonable to ask whether downloads from Discord carry any significant risks.</p><p>In general, security on Discord is comparable to standards that other major social networks adhere to, so in a typical case downloading a file is quite safe.</p><p>Still, like with any other internet-based transfer, it’s possible to run into a malicious file that could contain a virus or other malware. Examining multimedia files before downloading them (i.e. by watching the video online) and scanning them with anti-virus programs after receiving them are some of the steps that can be applied to prevent an accidental download of malware.</p><h4 id="How-can-I-download-images-and-pictures-on-Discord"><a href="#How-can-I-download-images-and-pictures-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="How can I download images and pictures on Discord?"></a>How can I download images and pictures on Discord?</h4><p>The procedure for downloading still images from Discord chats is just as simple as the one for videos described above. All it takes to complete it is to find the image you want, right-click anywhere on it on the screen, and pick the ‘Save Image’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-image-on-discord.jpg"                      alt="Save images on Discord"                ></p><p>This action will result in the appearance of the desired image in your designated download folder, so this is the place where you should look for the file. Since most online pictures are in low resolution, the transfer should be completed nearly instantly even if you are using an older computer or a weak smartphone.</p><h4 id="Can-I-Download-Files-Automatically-on-Discord"><a href="#Can-I-Download-Files-Automatically-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Can I Download Files Automatically on Discord?"></a>Can I Download Files Automatically on Discord?</h4><p>Another useful option that many users inquire about is the automated download of multimedia files attached to Discord chats. This can be done very easily with help of dedicated third-party software tools such as Discord video downloader or similar products. You can try Discord Image Downloader Go made by Seklfreak on Github: <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/Seklfreak/discord-image-downloader-go" >https://github.com/Seklfreak/discord-image-downloader-go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Using this simple program, you can specify which messages to scan and where to store any downloaded contents. Once this is set up, you will automatically receive all attachments from the selected Discord chats directly to your device, saving you the trouble to manually search for and download each file individually.</p><p>Here is a detailed video tutorial from Tom’s Tutorials about how to download and set up the Discord Image Downloader Go to auto-download all pictures at once.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>As we clearly demonstrated in this article, it’s possible to download Discord videos and share them elsewhere without too much effort or technical knowledge. In fact, the simplicity of media sharing is one of the main reasons why so many people are joining Discord in the first place.</p><p>Video downloads can be managed either directly (for PC users) or through external platforms and third-party products. In case you are not 100% satisfied with the default options provided by the platform, you could think about installing a Discord video downloader and setting it up to pick up all newly posted files even while you are not actively logged on to the platform. Such a tool can be very useful and make your experience on this communication app so much more fulfilling.</p><p>Either way, multimedia sharing and downloading on Discord won’t take long to get used to, after which you can start taking advantage of the full communication capacities at your disposal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/excellence-in-emoji-creation-leading-discotools-for-2024/"><u>Excellence in Emoji Creation  Leading DiscoTools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-boost-your-discord-experience-with-these-30-bots/"><u>In 2024, Boost Your Discord Experience with These 30 Bots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/mastering-discord-a-guide-to-filing-reports-against-misconduct-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Discord  A Guide to Filing Reports Against Misconduct for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-quickly-quicken-recognition-with-these-disco-tags/"><u>[Updated] Quickly Quicken Recognition with These Disco Tags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-create-stunning-pfps-that-stand-out-in-a-crowd/"><u>[Updated] How to Create Stunning PFPs That Stand Out in a Crowd</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-discord-video-calls-for-mobile-and-desktop-users-unpacked/"><u>[New] Discord Video Calls for Mobile & Desktop Users Unpacked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/elite-discord-screenshot-and-recording-tools-for-every-os-for-2024/"><u>Elite Discord Screenshot & Recording Tools for Every OS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unplugging-the-servers-deleting-discord-on-devices/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unplugging the Servers  Deleting Discord on Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-uncomplicated-video-snip-for-win10-users/"><u>[New] In 2024, Uncomplicated Video Snip for Win10 Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-ways-to-find-unlocking-codes-for-oppo-a1-5g-phones-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Oppo A1 5G Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-vertical-smartphone-techniques-for-better-video-for-2024/"><u>Updated The Art of Vertical Smartphone Techniques for Better Video for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-change-credit-card-from-your-apple-iphone-6-apple-id-and-apple-pay-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Change Credit Card from Your Apple iPhone 6 Apple ID and Apple Pay</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/popcorn-projections-thorough-review-of-film-snack-recorder-for-2024/"><u>Popcorn Projections  Thorough Review of Film Snack Recorder for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-the-professionals-guide-to-adding-youtube-content-to-powerpoint-slides/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Professional's Guide to Adding YouTube Content to PowerPoint Slides</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-audio-integration-your-youtube-playlist/"><u>2024 Approved  Audio Integration  Your YouTube Playlist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://animation-videos.techidaily.com/new-how-to-make-animated-videos-for-business-an-ultimate-guide-for-2024/"><u>New How to Make Animated Videos for Business – an Ultimate Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-7-macos-video-player-selections/"><u>Best 7 MacOS Video Player Selections</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.</p><p>Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.</p><p>One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Best Screen Recorder Software for Discord Desktop App</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord"></a>Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.</p><h3 id="1-OBS"><a href="#1-OBS" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS"></a>1. OBS</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.</p><p>There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.</p><h3 id="2-Bandicam"><a href="#2-Bandicam" class="headerlink" title="2. Bandicam"></a>2. Bandicam</h3><p>Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.</p><p>Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn’t involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.</p><h3 id="3-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#3-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="3. Wondershare Filmora"></a>3. Wondershare Filmora</h3><p>Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><h3 id="4-DemoCreator"><a href="#4-DemoCreator" class="headerlink" title="4. DemoCreator"></a>4. DemoCreator</h3><p>If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/" >Wondershare DemoCreator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.</p><p>You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.</p><h3 id="5-Camtasia"><a href="#5-Camtasia" class="headerlink" title="5. Camtasia"></a>5. Camtasia</h3><p>If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then <a class="link"   href="https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html" >Camtasia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.</p><p>However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord"></a>Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</h2><p>If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.</p><h3 id="2-Screen-Capture"><a href="#2-Screen-Capture" class="headerlink" title="2. Screen Capture"></a>2. Screen Capture</h3><p>One such option is <a class="link"   href="https://www.screencapture.com/" >Screen Capture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.</p><p>There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.</p><h3 id="3-Clipchamp"><a href="#3-Clipchamp" class="headerlink" title="3. Clipchamp"></a>3. Clipchamp</h3><p>If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer <a class="link"   href="https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/" >Clipchamp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.</p><p>It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.</p><h3 id="3-Screencast-o-matic"><a href="#3-Screencast-o-matic" class="headerlink" title="3. Screencast-o-matic"></a>3. Screencast-o-matic</h3><p>The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is <a class="link"   href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder" >Screencast-o-matic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.</p><p>The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android"><a href="#Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android"></a>Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.</p><h3 id="1-AZ-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#1-AZ-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="1. AZ Screen Recorder"></a>1. AZ Screen Recorder</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >AZ Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.</p><p>It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.</p><h3 id="2-Screen-Recorder-for-Game-Video-Call-Screenshots"><a href="#2-Screen-Recorder-for-Game-Video-Call-Screenshots" class="headerlink" title="2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots"></a>2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots</h3><p>Another option for Android is <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.</p><p>The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.</p><h3 id="3-Record-It"><a href="#3-Record-It" class="headerlink" title="3. Record It"></a>3. Record It</h3><p>If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545" >Record It! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.</p><p>The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Record-Discord-Video-Screen-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Record-Discord-Video-Screen-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</h2><p>If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.</p><p>Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.</p><p>You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.</p><p>If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.</p><p>Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.</p><p>The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/free-vs-paid-membership-decoding-the-value-of-disconitro-in-discord/"><u>Free vs Paid Membership  Decoding the Value of DiscoNitro in Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-ultimate-path-to-charming-your-digital-self-portrait/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Ultimate Path to Charming Your Digital Self-Portrait</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-complete-guide-to-personalizing-your-virtual-space-on-discord/"><u>2024 Approved  A Complete Guide to Personalizing Your Virtual Space on Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-securing-partner-approval-essential-steps-for-discord-identity-confirmation/"><u>[Updated] Securing Partner Approval  Essential Steps for Discord Identity Confirmation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/inside-top-15-emotes-a-look-at-the-masters-of-creation-for-2024/"><u>Inside Top 15 Emotes  A Look at the Masters of Creation for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-streamlining-discords-message-management-with-bulk-deletion/"><u>[Updated] Streamlining Discord's Message Management with Bulk Deletion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-exploring-advanced-features-of-discords-live-stream-functionality/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Exploring Advanced Features of Discord's Live Stream Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/adding-audio-magic-music-and-voiceovers-for-instagram-reels/"><u>Adding Audio Magic  Music & Voiceovers for Instagram Reels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-teaching-through-media-pro-video-editing-hacks/"><u>[New] Teaching Through Media  Pro Video Editing Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-creative-capture-uncovering-the-top-6-ways-to-document-minecraft-sessions/"><u>2024 Approved  Creative Capture  Uncovering the Top 6 Ways to Document Minecraft Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-snap-into-position-handhran-balancing-tricks/"><u>In 2024, Snap Into Position  Handhran Balancing Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/streamline-your-workflow-with-ez-grabber/"><u>Streamline Your Workflow with EZ Grabber</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-solutions-to-find-your-honor-magic-6-pro-current-location-of-a-mobile-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 3 Solutions to Find Your Honor Magic 6 Pro Current Location of a Mobile Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-must-do-tasks-for-enhanced-podcast-experience/"><u>[New] Must-Do Tasks for Enhanced Podcast Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-optimizing-your-facebook-budget-high-roi-animated-ad-best-practices-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Optimizing Your Facebook Budget  High-ROI Animated Ad Best Practices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/new-paramount-practices-in-gathering-your-precious-collection-of-high-fidelity-youtube-audio-for-2024/"><u>New Paramount Practices in Gathering Your Precious Collection of High-Fidelity YouTube Audio for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

However, as servers become crowded, they get bombarded with texts. And some of these texts have spoilers for games (or other stuff) that others may not want to know or read.

As you might be aware that Discord is quite popular and its cross-platform flexibility make it a favorite among gamers. You can connect to your friends over multiple devices with a single account.</p><p>Just like texts, even images, videos, and other attachments can be marked as spoilers. The process of marking images and videos as spoilers differs slightly from that of texts. So, how to add spoiler tags to other files? Here’s the rundown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoilers-to-image-video.jpg"                      alt="add spoiler to image and video on Discord"                ></p><p>Images can be tagged as spoilers before you upload them on servers.

But this does not apply to Discord server links. Furthermore, <strong>you cannot add spoiler tags to images, videos, and other files from the mobile app.</strong></p><p>For iOS, you can select and highlight the text that you want to hide. Then, tap open the context menu and click on the ‘Mark as Spoiler’ to hide the text.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-turn-off-the-Spoiler-tag"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-turn-off-the-Spoiler-tag" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to turn off the Spoiler tag?"></a>Bonus: How to turn off the Spoiler tag?</h2><p>For some reason, you may want to remove the spoiler tag from the spoiler texts.
