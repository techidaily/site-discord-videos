The only thing is, most people have quite a few interests, and so your server is likely to be fighting for attention amongst many other servers. Users can join up to 100, after all. So, a good <strong>Discord server logo</strong> is essential, as it makes it easier for your server to stand out and be found. This article will look at the best free Discord server logo makers.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel Tips</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs about Discord Logo and Icon</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Free-Discord-Server-Logo-Maker"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Free-Discord-Server-Logo-Maker" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker"></a>Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker</h2><p>We’ve picked out some of the best free logo makers, so you can customize your own Discord server logo.</p><h3 id="1-Logo-Bot"><a href="#1-Logo-Bot" class="headerlink" title="1  Logo.Bot"></a>1  Logo.Bot</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.logo.bot/" >Logo.Bot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> uses AI to generate your logo for you, so that you don’t need to worry about drawing anything. It can create a professional logo that you can easily download to use for your Discord server.</p><p>Firstly, it’ll ask for your ‘Company’ information – just use the name and description of your Discord server.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fill-in-company-info-logo-bot.jpg"                      alt="Discord Logo Maker - Logo Bot"                ></p><p>You’ll then be asked to choose a colour scheme, so pick one that is either relevant to your server or that you simply like. You can pick up at most 3 colors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-color-logo-bot.jpg"                      alt="Discord Logo Maker - Logo Bot - select color"                ></p><p>Next, it’ll give you a list of icons to choose from based on your details already entered, but you can still search for new keywords if you want. Choose up to five icons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-icon-preference.jpg"                      alt="Logo Bot icon Preference"                ></p><p>Logo Bot will then generate 3 logos based on the information provided before. You can then edit your favourite options using the site’s built-in tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-preview.jpg"                      alt="Logo Bot preview"                ></p><p>Once you’re done, you can download a free version of your logo as a low-resolution JPG. The problem is that it’ll come with a watermark. If you want the version that is best suited to Discord without a watermark, you’ll need to pay a one-off fee of $20.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt="Logo Bot editing interface"                ></p><h3 id="2-MyBrandNewLogo"><a href="#2-MyBrandNewLogo" class="headerlink" title="2  MyBrandNewLogo"></a>2  MyBrandNewLogo</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://mybrandnewlogo.com/" >MyBrandNewLogo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another option that makes it simple to create Discord logos. They even have a specialist tool just for Discord. You’ll start by giving the name of your server (‘Company’) again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-start-interface.jpg"                      alt="MyBrandNewLogo interface"                ></p><p>Then, you can enter some keywords to help it choose the icons to use as part of your logo.</p><p>With MyBrandNewLogo, the colour options are slightly more limited than with Logo.Bot, but you can also ask it to surprise you if you aren’t too fussed about the colour to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-select-color.jpg"                      alt="MyBrandNewLogo select color"                ></p><p>From there, you’ll again be shown a mix of icons and fonts combined to create a logo. You can then edit the layout of your logo, the background, add a slogan, change the icon and more to tailor it to your exact specifications.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt="MyBrandNewLogo editing"                ></p><p>Unfortunately again you do need to sign up and pay to download your logo. A basic package with one low-res file is €20, while the Professional pack costs €50.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-perchase-interface.jpg"                      alt="MyBrandNewLogo purchase interface"                ></p><h3 id="3-Logo-com"><a href="#3-Logo-com" class="headerlink" title="3  Logo.com"></a>3  Logo.com</h3><p>The third option is <a class="link"   href="https://logo.com/" >https://logo.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here you dive straight in – as soon as you’ve entered your Discord server name. You will see a list of logos that you can use as a base design. So it automatically reads your server name and searches for icons related to the term. For the generated logo files, click the Custmoize button to adjust.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-generated-logos.jpg"                      alt="Logo.com interface"                ></p><p>You can then work your way down the list on the left, editing the icons to decide where you want it to live, and how big it should be. You can adjust its design, the icons on the logo, the color and the colour themes of your logo, the text, including the font and any changes to how it’s displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt="Logo.com editing interface"                ></p><p>Once done, you can then preview your final logo. And yet again, you need to pay to download the full version. It’s $19.99 for a high-res PNG and JPG, but if you want a scalable Vector you need to pay $59.99 for the Starter Kit.</p><h3 id="4-BrandCrowd"><a href="#4-BrandCrowd" class="headerlink" title="4  BrandCrowd"></a>4  BrandCrowd</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.brandcrowd.com/" >BrandCrowd <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another logo creation site you could use, where again you simply enter your Discord server name and it’ll instantly generate icons for you to customize. Unlike Logo.com it doesn’t have a simple step-by-step editor, but instead it’s a lot more powerful, with various tools you can use to adjust shadows, layers and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-interface.jpg"                      alt="BrandCrowd logo maker interface"                ></p><p>Once you’ve played with the editor, you can click Preview to see how it’ll look on a dummy website (or even on merch), then Download to sign up and access the files…but again they are hidden behind a paywall. BrandCrowd is one of the more expensive options too – a one off fee is $45 to get the high res PNG and JPG as well as vector files, or you can subscribe for $15 per month to unlock unlimited edits and downloads. The previews are watermarked to prevent you from just taking them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt="BrandCrowd logo maker editing interface"                ></p><h3 id="5-Kapwing"><a href="#5-Kapwing" class="headerlink" title="5  Kapwing"></a>5  Kapwing</h3><p>The final recommendation is <a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/explore/discord-server-icon-maker-512x512-pixels" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Kapwing is, by far, the most comprehensive tool we’ve suggested so far. It isn’t just for creating logos, but working on all kinds of exportable content. The link we’ve included will take you straight to a dedicated workspace for Discord logos, but you’ll then need to upload all of your own imagery (although you can search Kapwing’s own resource collection) and make changes. It requires more skill, but the end results are more professional.</p><p>Using the menu at the top, you can play with text, add extra elements, or use the image tool to upload your own files or search Kapwing’s database.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-logo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt="Kapwing logo maker editing interface"                ></p><p>Once you’ve edited your logo, it’s already pre-set to download at 512 x 512. You’ll just need to create an account to access your download without a watermark, but it is free. The only drawback is that files are only available as JPG or GIF – so you can’t use a PNG with a transparent background.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the ‘free’ online tools for creating Discord server logos aren’t actually free, or they come with limitations. There are other options than using online tools to create a logo however.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Discord-Logos-and-Icons-Free-Download-Sites"><a href="#Part-2-Discord-Logos-and-Icons-Free-Download-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites"></a>Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites</h2><p>Rather than creating your own logo, you might want a helping hand – these download sites let you choose an existing icon, and edit it to your own tastes.</p><h3 id="1-Icons8"><a href="#1-Icons8" class="headerlink" title="1  Icons8"></a>1  Icons8</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://icons8.com/" >Icons8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is by far the best option of all the free icon download sites. It’s really easy to use, with clear categorization to make finding the perfect logo easier. You can download each icon in PNG or SVG format (or even PDF, if you wanted to for some reason) and customize the size. You can embed the HTML directly and, if you download the Lunacy editor, make tweaks to it before you download it. It’s super simple, and the only minor drawback is you’ll need to register an account, but it’s free.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons8-discord-icons-download.jpg"                      alt="Icons8 Discord logo Download"                ></p><h3 id="2-Iconfinder"><a href="#2-Iconfinder" class="headerlink" title="2  Iconfinder"></a>2  Iconfinder</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.iconfinder.com/" >Iconfinder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also relatively easy to navigate, and it also lets you download a PNG or SVG version of the file in a size that you prefer. You can’t edit, nor can you embed the HTML, and many of the icons are behind a paywall. However when you do find a free one, you can download it without a subscription.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iconfinder-discord-icon.jpg"                      alt="Iconfinder  Discord logo Download"                ></p><h3 id="3-BrandEPS"><a href="#3-BrandEPS" class="headerlink" title="3  BrandEPS"></a>3  BrandEPS</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.brandeps.com/" >BrandEPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another popular name for icon downloading but it specializes in existing brand logos. If you want something distinct and unique, you won’t find it here. But if your Discord server is about an existing brand, you can probably download its logo here in either a vector EPS or as part of a zip file with SVG, PNG and JPG versions. No need to sign up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/brandeps-discord-logo-vector.jpg"                      alt="BrandEPS Discord logo Download"                ></p><h3 id="4-FreePNGLogos"><a href="#4-FreePNGLogos" class="headerlink" title="4  FreePNGLogos"></a>4  FreePNGLogos</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.freepnglogos.com/" >FreePNGLogos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another database of existing company icons and logos, and as you can probably guess from the name, they’re available to download as PNG files. The sizes are limited to the size it’s been uploaded as, and there’s no easy way to browse, you’ll need to search using key terms and hope you find something suitable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/freepnglogos-discord-logo-png.jpg"                      alt="FreePNGLogos Discord logo Download"                ></p><h3 id="5-SeekLogo"><a href="#5-SeekLogo" class="headerlink" title="5  SeekLogo"></a>5  SeekLogo</h3><p>Finally, <a class="link"   href="https://seeklogo.com/" >SeekLogo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has a large database of corporate logos but they’re not optimized icons, they’re full size logos including full business names. Downloads are mainly in SVG format, and again the option to browse is minimal, you’ll be relying on search terms and the categorization of icons isn’t the most intuitive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seeklogo-discord.jpg"                      alt="SeekLogo Discord logo Download"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Making-A-Logo-for-Your-Discord-Server-Channel-Tips"><a href="#Part-3-Making-A-Logo-for-Your-Discord-Server-Channel-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel - Tips"></a>Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel - Tips</h2><p>When you’re naming your server, a longer name might be harder to remember. If you can create a name that you can then abbreviate, you can include the abbreviation in your logo design, so it’s even easier to find your server. Even better, if it can be an acronym (an abbreviation that also forms its own short word) then it’ll be even more memorable.</p><p>The other key tip when creating your Discord server logo is to embrace your creativity! Don’t be scared to really make your logo stand out, especially when it’s around a topic that other Discord servers may exist for. You need to make it easy for your server logo to be understood and remembered, and a bold logo is ideal.</p><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-a-Discord-Logo"><a href="#1-What-is-a-Discord-Logo" class="headerlink" title="1. What is a Discord Logo?"></a>1. What is a Discord Logo?</h4><p>A <strong>Discord logo</strong> is an icon that’s associated with your Discord server. For any Discord user, the servers they’re a member of are listed by logo, so making a distinctive one that is clearly associated with your server is important for helping people to easily find the server they’re looking for.</p><h4 id="2-What-is-the-Best-Size-for-Discord-Channel-Logos"><a href="#2-What-is-the-Best-Size-for-Discord-Channel-Logos" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the Best Size for Discord Channel Logos?"></a>2. What is the Best Size for Discord Channel Logos?</h4><p>The size of your Discord logo is important, because if it’s too small then it means the logo will be poor quality, while if it’s too large then finer details just won’t be visible – the logo is only ever shown as a small icon. Aim for 512 x 512 pixels.</p><h4 id="3-What-is-the-Best-Discord-Logo-Shape"><a href="#3-What-is-the-Best-Discord-Logo-Shape" class="headerlink" title="3. What is the Best Discord Logo Shape?"></a>3. What is the Best Discord Logo Shape?</h4><p>Discord logos are displayed as circles, so the easiest way to make sure your logo is properly displayed is to create it as a circle. If you upload a logo in a different shape, you risk having part of your logo cut off, or it being centered incorrectly.</p><h4 id="4-How-to-Change-the-Server-Logo-on-Discord"><a href="#4-How-to-Change-the-Server-Logo-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="4. How to Change the Server Logo on Discord?"></a>4. How to Change the Server Logo on Discord?</h4><p>When you first create your Discord server, you’ll be shown a ‘Getting started’ list where one of the actions is to personalize the server with an icon.</p><p>If you’ve already established your Discord server and no longer see this option, then you can simply right-click on your server to find a menu option for the server settings, where you’ll also find the option to update your server logo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.</p><p>Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.</p><p>One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Best Screen Recorder Software for Discord Desktop App</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord"></a>Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.</p><h3 id="1-OBS"><a href="#1-OBS" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS"></a>1. OBS</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.</p><p>There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.</p><h3 id="2-Bandicam"><a href="#2-Bandicam" class="headerlink" title="2. Bandicam"></a>2. Bandicam</h3><p>Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.</p><p>Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn’t involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.</p><h3 id="3-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#3-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="3. Wondershare Filmora"></a>3. Wondershare Filmora</h3><p>Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><h3 id="4-DemoCreator"><a href="#4-DemoCreator" class="headerlink" title="4.

DemoCreator</h3><p>If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/" >Wondershare DemoCreator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.</p><p>You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.</p><h3 id="5-Camtasia"><a href="#5-Camtasia" class="headerlink" title="5. Camtasia"></a>5. Camtasia</h3><p>If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then <a class="link"   href="https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html" >Camtasia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.</p><p>However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord"></a>Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</h2><p>If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.</p><h3 id="2-Screen-Capture"><a href="#2-Screen-Capture" class="headerlink" title="2. Screen Capture"></a>2. Screen Capture</h3><p>One such option is <a class="link"   href="https://www.screencapture.com/" >Screen Capture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.</p><p>There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.</p><h3 id="3-Clipchamp"><a href="#3-Clipchamp" class="headerlink" title="3. Clipchamp"></a>3. Clipchamp</h3><p>If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer <a class="link"   href="https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/" >Clipchamp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.</p><p>It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.</p><h3 id="3-Screencast-o-matic"><a href="#3-Screencast-o-matic" class="headerlink" title="3. Screencast-o-matic"></a>3. Screencast-o-matic</h3><p>The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is <a class="link"   href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder" >Screencast-o-matic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.</p><p>The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android"><a href="#Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android"></a>Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.</p><h3 id="1-AZ-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#1-AZ-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="1. AZ Screen Recorder"></a>1. AZ Screen Recorder</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >AZ Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.</p><p>It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.</p><h3 id="2-Screen-Recorder-for-Game-Video-Call-Screenshots"><a href="#2-Screen-Recorder-for-Game-Video-Call-Screenshots" class="headerlink" title="2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots"></a>2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots</h3><p>Another option for Android is <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.</p><p>The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.</p><h3 id="3-Record-It"><a href="#3-Record-It" class="headerlink" title="3. Record It"></a>3. Record It</h3><p>If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545" >Record It! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.</p><p>The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Record-Discord-Video-Screen-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Record-Discord-Video-Screen-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</h2><p>If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.</p><p>Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.</p><p>You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.</p><p>If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.</p><p>Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.</p><p>The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-the-secrets-of-effective-dispute-resolution-on-discord-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling the Secrets of Effective Dispute Resolution on Discord for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/everything-on-discord-stickers-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>Everything on Discord Stickers  A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-tier-designers-making-magic-in-discord-emojis/"><u>2024 Approved  Top-Tier Designers  Making Magic in Discord Emojis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/mastery-in-locating-the-right-discord-server-amidst-thousands/"><u>Mastery in Locating the Right Discord Server Amidst Thousands</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/expertly-record-your-discord-sessions-for-2024/"><u>Expertly Record Your Discord Sessions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-discord-sticker-guide-essential-info/"><u>[New] In 2024, Discord Sticker Guide - Essential Info</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-ultimate-list-of-discord-bots-to-amplify-your-server/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Ultimate List of Discord Bots to Amplify Your Server</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/beginners-guide-to-motion-artistry-for-2024/"><u>Beginner's Guide to Motion Artistry for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/best-video-repair-tool-to-fix-and-repair-corrupted-video-files-of-huawei-nova-12-by-stellar-video-repair-mobile-video-repair/"><u>Best Video Repair tool to Fix and Repair Corrupted video files of Huawei Nova 12</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-how-to-download-instagram-highlights-in-2-ways-for-2024/"><u>[New] How to Download Instagram Highlights in 2 Ways for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/splitscreen-designer/"><u>SplitScreen Designer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/useful-ways-that-can-help-to-effectively-recover-deleted-files-from-infinix-smart-8-by-fonelab-android-recover-data/"><u>Useful ways that can help to effectively recover deleted files from Infinix Smart 8</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-professional-tips-integrating-closed-captions-with-ease-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] Professional Tips  Integrating Closed Captions with Ease on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-choice-streamline-your-youtube-audio/"><u>2024 Approved  Best Choice  Streamline Your YouTube Audio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-innovate-how-you-connect-with-tech-best-text-interpretation-tools-on-mac/"><u>In 2024, Innovate How You Connect with Tech  Best Text Interpretation Tools on Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-audio-interfaces-unveiled-the-podcasters-must-have-list/"><u>In 2024, Top Audio Interfaces Unveiled  The Podcaster's Must-Have List</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

And unlike other apps, Discord does not allow users to mass-delete their message history. For some, that can sound like a nightmare because of privacy and security reasons. You will have to wade through every message, deleting each of them, one by one.</p><p>However, if you find yourself in that position, fret not because there are several solutions to help you get around this limitation. Unfortunately, none of them are perfect.</p><p>Since there is no official method of mass deleting messages, these workarounds are shoddy, but until Discord offers an official solution, we’ll have to do with them.</p><p>If you’re looking to mass-delete your messages from a server or channel on Discord, here’s how you will go about it for the desktop and mobile versions:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: How to Delete Direct Messages on Discord</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Deleting Channel Messages in Discord</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part 4: Deleting Messages with Discord Clear Chat Bot</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part5"><strong>Part 5: Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-Discord-Message-Types"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-Discord-Message-Types" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types"></a>Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types</h2><p>In Discord, you will see two types of messages: Direct Messages and Channel Messages in servers. Here are the differences between the two:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct Messages</strong>: These messages are private and held between two users</li><li><strong>Channel Messages</strong>: These messages are sent in a channel or a specific group</li></ul><p>Both of these message types abide by different rules and functions. In the early days of Discord, users had the luxury of deleting messages in bulk.</p><p>However, this was soon changed because the mass execution directly affected the app’s database. Since then, the application has adopted specific rules regarding message deletion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

If you don’t want to show messages from a particular friend, you can remove the chat copy, and it will disappear from the messages temporarily, although it will still be visible in the recipient’s chats. And if the friend contacts you again, the messages will show.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-discord-copy.jpg"                      alt="Remove Discord Direct Message Copy"                ></p><p>You can delete the local copy of messages by following the steps below:</p><ol><li>Open the Discord program on your computer and go to the chat panel of the person whom you direct messaged;</li><li>Tap on the ‘Message’ option on the left side, and then select the ‘Direct Message’ option on the top left side;</li><li>Select the message that you want to delete and click the 3 dots to click on Delete Message, then the message you sent will be deleted at your end.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-discord-direct-message.jpg"                      alt="delete Discord Message"                ></p><p>The procedure for deleting DMs from your Discord smartphone application applies for both the Android and IOS application, and it is as follows:</p><ol><li>Open the Discord app on your smartphone</li><li>Find the message that you want to delete</li><li>Tap and hold the message. You will be presented with a list</li><li>Tap ‘Delete’ on that list</li><li>Confirm your decision by tapping ‘Delete’ once again</li><li>The message will be deleted</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Delete-Channel-Messages-in-Discord"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Delete-Channel-Messages-in-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Delete Channel Messages in Discord?"></a>Part 3: How to Delete Channel Messages in Discord?</h2><p>This method has to be the most effective and easy way to delete a Discord message, and it’s a simple, straightforward procedure:</p><ol><li>Go to the message and glide over it to reveal the three-tier settings icon</li><li>Click on it to show options, and then select Delete Message</li></ol><p>To do this individually, you will need to use the mouse consistently, eating up a lot of time. If you wish to do it by keyboard, you can do so, provided you know the sequence for the keyboard commands for deletion.</p><p>Here is a more detailed breakdown of the sequence:</p><ol><li>Select the Chat panel that you want to delete</li><li>Hover your cursor over the messages you wish to delete</li><li>A three-dot icon will appear on the right side of the message</li><li>Click on the icon, and a pop-menu will show</li><li>On the pop-up menu, select ‘Delete’</li><li>You will be prompted with a confirmation for deleting the message</li><li>Tick the confirmation and tap the ‘Delete’ button</li><li>Your message will be deleted</li></ol><p>At first glance, it seems like a long and tedious process, but once you get down to doing it and develop a rhythm, it is an easy task.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Deleting-Message-with-Discord-Clear-Chat-Bot"><a href="#Part-4-Deleting-Message-with-Discord-Clear-Chat-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Deleting Message with Discord Clear Chat Bot"></a>Part 4: Deleting Message with Discord Clear Chat Bot</h2><p>Please keep in mind that Discord has changed its policy regarding bots, going from discouraging their use to outright flagging them as a violation of its terms.</p><p>Using bots can put you at risk of termination from the app, so we would not advise you to adopt this method, and if you do, please tread with caution.</p><p>With that said, many users report that using self-bots does not significantly lead to any disciplinary action from Discord, given that the reason for use is not harmful or disruptive.</p><p>Discord requires that all bots are tracked through its ‘Develop Portal.’ Self-bots run on a Discord API token and can circumvent this rule, allowing them access to API requests hence automating many tasks, such as deleting messages.</p><p>The Discord API supports a POST request, letting bots swiftly discard messages less than fourteen days old.

That leads us to the possibility of utilizing the ‘AutoHotkey’ script to automate the process.</p><p>Most developers have come up with codes that can delete Discord messages from your account on a mass scale. We’ll be expanding on one of the most popular instances of this: the AutoHotkey script.</p><p>Before you get started with this, you will need an ‘AutoHotkey installer.’ Continue the process by:</p><ol><li>Download and install the ‘AutoHotkey installer’ ;</li><li>Head onto your desktop, right-click and click ‘New’ on the drop-down menu;</li><li>Choose the ‘AutoHotkey script’ and right-click on this file and edit with ‘Notepad’</li><li>Delete everything in the script and paste the following code</li></ol><p><strong><em>t::</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Loop, 100000</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>{</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Up}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, ^a</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {BS}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Enter}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Enter}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>sleep, 100</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Return</em></strong></p><ol><li>Save the file as any name that you wish to</li><li>Once you’ve done that, launch Discord and double-click on the script file</li><li>Open the chat data that you wish to delete and press T</li><li>The script will now delete all the messages</li></ol><p>To stop the script, click on the H icon located on the right side of your taskbar and select Pause Script.</p><p>This is the process by which you can use an ‘Autohotkey script’ to delete messages in bulk. Please note that this option is only available to Windows users as AutoHotkey does not currently work on macOS.</p><p>Ideally, you’ll want the following things from your AutoHotkey script:</p><ol><li>A toggle key for turning it on and off</li><li>The complete keyboard sequence with stops between each step</li></ol><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: you can delete a message you sent, but there’s no saying if the other person took a screenshot before you got around to deleting it. Things on the internet tend to stick around. So, as a safe bet, it’s a good idea to take some time to consider what you wrote before pressing send to avoid any regrets.</p><h4 id="You-May-Also-Interested-In"><a href="#You-May-Also-Interested-In" class="headerlink" title="You May Also Interested In"></a>You May Also Interested In</h4><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Discord Font Generators [Online&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;Android] <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Discord Emoji Makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10+ Best Free Discord Voice Changers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="FAQs-About-Deleting-Discord-Messages"><a href="#FAQs-About-Deleting-Discord-Messages" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Deleting Discord Messages"></a>FAQs About Deleting Discord Messages</h2><h4 id="1-Can-I-Recover-A-Deleted-Message-on-Discord"><a href="#1-Can-I-Recover-A-Deleted-Message-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.</p><p>Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.</p><p>One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Best Screen Recorder Software for Discord Desktop App</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord"></a>Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.</p><h3 id="1-OBS"><a href="#1-OBS" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS"></a>1. OBS</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.</p><p>There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.</p><h3 id="2-Bandicam"><a href="#2-Bandicam" class="headerlink" title="2. Bandicam"></a>2. Bandicam</h3><p>Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.</p><p>Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn’t involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.</p><h3 id="3-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#3-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="3. Wondershare Filmora"></a>3. Wondershare Filmora</h3><p>Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><h3 id="4-DemoCreator"><a href="#4-DemoCreator" class="headerlink" title="4. DemoCreator"></a>4. DemoCreator</h3><p>If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/" >Wondershare DemoCreator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.</p><p>You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.</p><h3 id="5-Camtasia"><a href="#5-Camtasia" class="headerlink" title="5. Camtasia"></a>5. Camtasia</h3><p>If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then <a class="link"   href="https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html" >Camtasia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.</p><p>However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord"></a>Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</h2><p>If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.</p><h3 id="2-Screen-Capture"><a href="#2-Screen-Capture" class="headerlink" title="2. Screen Capture"></a>2. Screen Capture</h3><p>One such option is <a class="link"   href="https://www.screencapture.com/" >Screen Capture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.</p><p>There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.</p><h3 id="3-Clipchamp"><a href="#3-Clipchamp" class="headerlink" title="3. Clipchamp"></a>3. Clipchamp</h3><p>If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer <a class="link"   href="https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/" >Clipchamp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.</p><p>It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.</p><h3 id="3-Screencast-o-matic"><a href="#3-Screencast-o-matic" class="headerlink" title="3. Screencast-o-matic"></a>3. Screencast-o-matic</h3><p>The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is <a class="link"   href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder" >Screencast-o-matic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.</p><p>The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android"><a href="#Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android"></a>Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.</p><h3 id="1-AZ-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#1-AZ-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="1. AZ Screen Recorder"></a>1. AZ Screen Recorder</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >AZ Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.</p><p>It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.</p><h3 id="2-Screen-Recorder-for-Game-Video-Call-Screenshots"><a href="#2-Screen-Recorder-for-Game-Video-Call-Screenshots" class="headerlink" title="2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots"></a>2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots</h3><p>Another option for Android is <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.</p><p>The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.</p><h3 id="3-Record-It"><a href="#3-Record-It" class="headerlink" title="3. Record It"></a>3. Record It</h3><p>If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545" >Record It! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.</p><p>The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Record-Discord-Video-Screen-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Record-Discord-Video-Screen-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</h2><p>If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.</p><p>Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.</p><p>You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.</p><p>If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file.

The platform has around 120 million active users monthly as of early 2021.</p><p>With so many users on the forum, it is normal to have some “bad apples” in the mix. There are trolls, miscreants, and spammers who ruin the experience for everyone else.</p><p>You can report them to Discord Trust and Safety team. They would take appropriate action against these nuisances after reviewing evidence.</p><p>Reporting helps make healthier communities and allows you to avoid conflicts and outbreaks due to suspicious activity on the platform.</p><p>Today we will look into how to report someone on Discord using desktop and mobile devices. Moreover, we will look at other ways to deal with indecent behavior, such as kicking people or banning them.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Report-Users-on-Discord-Desktop"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Report-Users-on-Discord-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Report Users on Discord Desktop"></a>Part 1: How to Report Users on Discord Desktop</h2><p>Before you can report a person to Discord’s Trust and Safety team, you will need to enable Discord’s developer mode.</p><p>Enabling this mode will allow you to obtain the information necessary to file your report.</p><ol><li>Login to your Discord account on PC or Mac</li><li>You will see a gear icon next to your username to the bottom left of your screen; click on it</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg"                      alt="Discord User Settings"                ></p><ol><li>There will be a list of options in the sidebar; from here, click on “Appearance”</li><li>Next, scroll down until you find “Developer Mode” under Advanced; turn it on</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-discord-developer-mode.jpg"                      alt="Turn on Discord Developer Mode"                ></p><p>After enabling developer mode, you will now need the user ID of the person you are reporting. To get someone’s user ID:</p><ol><li>Right-click on their username</li><li>From the list of options that appear, choose “Copy ID”</li><li>Paste this user ID somewhere so that you can access it later</li></ol><p>To report a specific message, you need to get the message link as well.

If you are a moderator or server owner, you can kick people for violating Discord’s guidelines.</p><p>However, it is essential to have a reason to kick someone. Otherwise, it may be seen as an abuse of power.</p><p>Here are activities to look out for before kicking someone:</p><ul><li>Spam messages</li><li>Harassment</li><li>Sharing child pornography</li><li>Violating IP rights</li><li>Sharing viruses</li><li>Advocating self-harm or suicide</li><li>Distributing gore content or animal cruelty</li><li>Life threats to another user</li></ul><p>If you see someone involved in these, you can kick them off your server or report them to moderators or server owners if you don’t have kicking authority.</p><p>In case the moderators or owners do not act on your complaint, you can always contact the Trust and Safety team.</p><p>If you happen to be a moderator or server owner, you have the authority to kick people off your server. Here is how to do it:</p><ol><li>Go to the correct channel on Discord</li><li>Find the user from the user list on the right side of the screen</li><li>Right-click on their username and then select “Kick”</li><li>Click on “Kick” again to confirm your decision</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-About-Discord-Reporting"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-About-Discord-Reporting" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs About Discord Reporting"></a>Part 4: FAQs About Discord Reporting</h2><p>There is no need to Google responses to “How do you report someone on Discord,” we have answers to the most frequently asked questions:</p><h3 id="Can-I-Report-People-on-Discord-Anonymously"><a href="#Can-I-Report-People-on-Discord-Anonymously" class="headerlink" title="Can I Report People on Discord Anonymously?"></a>Can I Report People on Discord Anonymously?</h3><p>According to a <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/ave1x3/are%5Freports%5Fanonymous/" >moderator on Discord’s subreddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, information regarding a reported case remains between the T&amp;S team and the reporter.

If you are looking for something simple and quick, then pick a free open-source program. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to help you record and change your voice, then consider a program that has added paid versions.</p><ol><li><strong>What Operation System You Use? Windows, Mac, or More</strong></li></ol><p>The voice changer for Discord Mac versions are a little less common on the Internet. If you are a Mac user, then consider sticking to the app offerings on Apple-moderated marketplaces. Changing your voice for Discord isn’t a difficult task, so you should probably stay clear from paid programs if you are a Mac user.</p><ol><li><strong>What Voice Effects Do You Want?</strong></li></ol><p>If you are looking for a female voice changer for Discord, then mostly every voice changer will suit you. Every app&#x2F;program listed on this article has a female voice version. The reason for this is because a female voice is often considered higher pitched and lighter, and such a tone is available through all the apps&#x2F;programs listed above.</p><ol><li><strong>Is It Easy to Get the Tool to Work?</strong></li></ol><p>If you are having a hard time getting the voice changer to work with Discord, then take a look online and especially on YouTube. There are often users on YouTube who have had the same problem and who are showing off a new solution.</p><p>If you are really struggling to find a solution, then look for ways to get pre-recorded content into Discord. Usually, the people who offer solutions on Google and Bing to this problem will also have the solution to getting your funny voice changer to work with Discord.</p><ol><li><strong>Does it Have a Free Trial?</strong></li></ol><p>One of the primary reasons why shouldn’t pay for a voice changer, at least at first, is because there is no guarantee that program will work. It is better if you download and try a free version or use a free trial. That way, if it doesn’t work, you haven’t lost anything.</p><p>Do not be fooled into thinking you have to pay for each tool. Many voice changers will make it seem like their only options are paid versions, but this is often not the case. Even those that do not have a free version will often have a free trial that you can exploit.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-Rating-the-Free-Voice-Changers"><a href="#Conclusion-Rating-the-Free-Voice-Changers" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion - Rating the Free Voice Changers"></a>Conclusion - Rating the Free Voice Changers</h2><p>Since each of the tools on this article are free, there is nothing stopping you from downloading all of them and trying each one. Just be sure you are downloading from a reliable and safe place because some websites host malicious downloads that are not what they say they are.</p><p>You may also have a few problems in terms of compatibility. For example, some will only work on Windows devices, or iOS devices, or on Android devices. Though none of the programs listed in this article are iOS only.</p><p>Are you a fan of one or more free voice changer for discord?

Even though Discord makes communication easier, you may need a break from around-the-clock connectivity for various reasons.</p><p>Discord works on desktop platforms and smartphones, with a blend of a VoIP chat system, a chat lobby, and a message board in a single app. Therefore, you can attempt to delete a server off on any device that you may have Discord downloaded and active on.</p><p>Most server owners choose to delete their Discord server when too many extra, strange, or ill-meaning visitors are visiting.</p><p>Servers are more like chat rooms inside the application. Deleting them is a relatively simple process – as you will learn from our <strong>how to delete server on Discord</strong> tips – however, their retrieval is impossible.</p><p>Once the server has been removed, you can not “undo the process” or recreate it. Therefore, be absolutely sure and proceed with caution.</p><p>It is also advised to skim through any essential files that you might have on the server. Back them up before letting it go forever.</p><p>And lastly, ensure that this is what you intend on doing because deleting a Discord server is permanent. Here are the simple steps to follow on <strong>how to delete a server on Discord</strong>:</p><ol><li>Open the Discord desktop app and click on the server you want to delete</li><li>Once you select the server, there will be an options list under the server’s name</li><li>Click the “server setting” button from the menu (This will be the second option on the list)</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-settings.jpg"                      alt="Discord Server Settings"                ></p><ol><li>At the end of the sidebar, you will find the option “delete the server on the left side.” Click it</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deleting-discord-server-overview.jpg"                      alt="Discord Server Overview"                ></p><p><strong>Image</strong>: <em>The image shows the screen that pops up after clicking “Server settings,” here, the delete button can be seen in red.</em></p><ol><li>After clicking, a pop-up window will appear, asking for confirmation</li><li>Confirm by entering the server’s name and authentication code; this is only required when two-factor authentication is enabled</li><li>Click on “delete server” to confirm</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/double-confirm-to-delete-server.jpg"                      alt="Discord Server delete confirm"                ></p><p><strong>Image:</strong> <em>As mentioned, you must be sure you want to permanently lose a server and all of its content before deleting it; this prompt serves the same purpose</em></p><p>You can also transfer your server’s ownership to another individual if you do not want to delete it.

Read on to find out how to make a video call on Discord.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Best Settings for Discord Video Call</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Make a Server Video Call on Discord?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs about Discord Video Call</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Settings-for-Discord-Video-Call"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Settings-for-Discord-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Settings for Discord Video Call"></a>Part 1: Best Settings for Discord Video Call</h2><p>Before you start calling everyone, you’ll want to check your settings to make sure you have the best experience. It’s important to make sure you’ve got your best equipment setup to work for the highest quality audio and video possible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg"                      alt="Discord User Settings option"                ></p><p>So, start by heading to the User Settings page. You’ll find this at the bottom left of the screen – look for the cog icon next to your name. You won’t see this on mobile, this is only on the desktop app and the web browser version of Discord.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-settings.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video Call Settings"                ></p><p>Once you’ve opened settings, you’ll want to click on the <strong>Voice &amp; Video</strong> tab. Here you can check your microphone settings and adjust the volume, and choose your camera. If you’re using an external camera instead of the built-in option, check that the right one is selected in the dropdown.</p><p>You can also use this opportunity to run a test video – so that you know you’re well-lit, properly framed and otherwise good to go. You can adjust the lighting in your room or move the camera if you don’t feel it’s quite right.</p><p>One quick note for the web browser version of Discord – you’ll be asked to grant permission to your microphone and camera. Make sure you allow the site to use your equipment otherwise it won’t work on the video call.</p><p>Once you are happy, just click the close button at the top right of the settings options.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Private-Video-Call-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Private-Video-Call-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?"></a>Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?</h2><p>Once you’ve got your settings ready, you’re set to make your private Discord video call. If you’re doing it on the web browser or desktop app, you’ll need to first navigate to the inbox you share with the person you want to call. Do this by clicking on the Home button at the top left – you’ll then get a list of all your contacts.</p><p>If you’re only calling one person then it’s easy – just click on their name.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-discord-friend.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video Call with Friends"                ></p><p>If you want to call a private group, you need to click the + button and then create a group DM. Add the names of the users you want to call.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friend-group-video-call-discord.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video Call with group"                ></p><p>Once you’re in the direct message window of the person or group you want to call, you need to look at the buttons at the top right of the screen. The second icon that looks like a video camera is the one you’re looking for. Click that and you’ll start a video call.</p><p>You’ll see yourself on screen at this point, but you’ll need to wait until the other person or group members have joined the call for the chat to properly begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video Call interface"                ></p><p>The process of making video call on Discord mobile is essentially identical. You just need to open the direct message group and click on the video call icon, which is still at the top right of your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discrod-personal-video-call-mobile.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video Call interface on mobile"                ></p><p>You’ll need to give permissions for the Discord mobile app to use your microphone and camera if you haven’t already.</p><p>Once you’ve finished your video call on either desktop or mobile, just hit the red button to end it and switch your camera off again.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Server-Video-Call-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Server-Video-Call-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make a Server Video Call on Discord?"></a>Part 3: How to Make a Server Video Call on Discord?</h2><p>If you want to make a group video call on a public server, you again need to first navigate to the server. Once you’re there, you’ll need to join the voice channel that you should see on the left side of the screen.</p><p>Once you’re in the voice channel, click Lounge, Community Hangout or Stream Room, and then switch on your camera by clicking the ‘Video’ button. You’ll find this at the bottom-left of the screen.
