And unlike other apps, Discord does not allow users to mass-delete their message history. For some, that can sound like a nightmare because of privacy and security reasons. You will have to wade through every message, deleting each of them, one by one.</p><p>However, if you find yourself in that position, fret not because there are several solutions to help you get around this limitation. Unfortunately, none of them are perfect.</p><p>Since there is no official method of mass deleting messages, these workarounds are shoddy, but until Discord offers an official solution, we’ll have to do with them.</p><p>If you’re looking to mass-delete your messages from a server or channel on Discord, here’s how you will go about it for the desktop and mobile versions:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: How to Delete Direct Messages on Discord</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Deleting Channel Messages in Discord</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part 4: Deleting Messages with Discord Clear Chat Bot</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part5"><strong>Part 5: Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-Discord-Message-Types"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-Discord-Message-Types" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types"></a>Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types</h2><p>In Discord, you will see two types of messages: Direct Messages and Channel Messages in servers. Here are the differences between the two:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct Messages</strong>: These messages are private and held between two users</li><li><strong>Channel Messages</strong>: These messages are sent in a channel or a specific group</li></ul><p>Both of these message types abide by different rules and functions. In the early days of Discord, users had the luxury of deleting messages in bulk.</p><p>However, this was soon changed because the mass execution directly affected the app’s database. Since then, the application has adopted specific rules regarding message deletion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

If you don’t want to show messages from a particular friend, you can remove the chat copy, and it will disappear from the messages temporarily, although it will still be visible in the recipient’s chats. And if the friend contacts you again, the messages will show.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-discord-copy.jpg"                      alt="Remove Discord Direct Message Copy"                ></p><p>You can delete the local copy of messages by following the steps below:</p><ol><li>Open the Discord program on your computer and go to the chat panel of the person whom you direct messaged;</li><li>Tap on the ‘Message’ option on the left side, and then select the ‘Direct Message’ option on the top left side;</li><li>Select the message that you want to delete and click the 3 dots to click on Delete Message, then the message you sent will be deleted at your end.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-discord-direct-message.jpg"                      alt=" delete Discord Message  "                ></p><p>The procedure for deleting DMs from your Discord smartphone application applies for both the Android and IOS application, and it is as follows:</p><ol><li>Open the Discord app on your smartphone</li><li>Find the message that you want to delete</li><li>Tap and hold the message. You will be presented with a list</li><li>Tap ‘Delete’ on that list</li><li>Confirm your decision by tapping ‘Delete’ once again</li><li>The message will be deleted</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Delete-Channel-Messages-in-Discord"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Delete-Channel-Messages-in-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Delete Channel Messages in Discord?"></a>Part 3: How to Delete Channel Messages in Discord?</h2><p>This method has to be the most effective and easy way to delete a Discord message, and it’s a simple, straightforward procedure:</p><ol><li>Go to the message and glide over it to reveal the three-tier settings icon</li><li>Click on it to show options, and then select Delete Message</li></ol><p>To do this individually, you will need to use the mouse consistently, eating up a lot of time. If you wish to do it by keyboard, you can do so, provided you know the sequence for the keyboard commands for deletion.</p><p>Here is a more detailed breakdown of the sequence:</p><ol><li>Select the Chat panel that you want to delete</li><li>Hover your cursor over the messages you wish to delete</li><li>A three-dot icon will appear on the right side of the message</li><li>Click on the icon, and a pop-menu will show</li><li>On the pop-up menu, select ‘Delete’</li><li>You will be prompted with a confirmation for deleting the message</li><li>Tick the confirmation and tap the ‘Delete’ button</li><li>Your message will be deleted</li></ol><p>At first glance, it seems like a long and tedious process, but once you get down to doing it and develop a rhythm, it is an easy task.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Deleting-Message-with-Discord-Clear-Chat-Bot"><a href="#Part-4-Deleting-Message-with-Discord-Clear-Chat-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Deleting Message with Discord Clear Chat Bot"></a>Part 4: Deleting Message with Discord Clear Chat Bot</h2><p>Please keep in mind that Discord has changed its policy regarding bots, going from discouraging their use to outright flagging them as a violation of its terms.</p><p>Using bots can put you at risk of termination from the app, so we would not advise you to adopt this method, and if you do, please tread with caution.</p><p>With that said, many users report that using self-bots does not significantly lead to any disciplinary action from Discord, given that the reason for use is not harmful or disruptive.</p><p>Discord requires that all bots are tracked through its ‘Develop Portal.’ Self-bots run on a Discord API token and can circumvent this rule, allowing them access to API requests hence automating many tasks, such as deleting messages.</p><p>The Discord API supports a POST request, letting bots swiftly discard messages less than fourteen days old. Messages that are older than this timeframe can be queued and discarded one-by-one.</p><p>One particular bot that is of interest to us is the MEE6. It is used to control moderation, set-up leveling, manage music, and much more, including mass-deleting messages on Discord.</p><p>We’ve outlined a few commands you can use to delete your chats. These are as follows:</p><ol><li>Go to the official MEE6 website and click on the button that says Add to Discord</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-bot-mee6.jpg"                      alt="delete messages on discord with mee6 bot"                ></p><ol><li>You’ll be prompted to authorize so that MEE6 bot can access your username, and know what server you’re in.</li><li>Pin-point the server you want to add the bot and then set up to connect MEE6 to the Discord server.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-server-to-add-mee6-bot-discord.jpg"                      alt="how to delete discord message with mee6 bot"                ></p><ol><li>Click Authorize again and the bot will be added to your Discord server soon;</li><li>To enable MEE6 to clear the chat, you should enable the Moderator plugin first. Click the Moderator option under Plugins first, and then click Yes.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mee6-moderator-plugin-moderator.jpg"                      alt="remove discord message with mee 6"                ></p><ol><li>Now go to the server in your Discord and type in “!clear @username” to remove every message sent by the user you’ve mentioned.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-channel-message-in-bulk-mee6-discord.jpg"                      alt="delete discord channel message with MEE6 Bot  "                ></p><p>To clear the last 100 messages on your server, type in “!clear 100”. You can replace 100 with any number of your choice. However, MEE6 can’t delete messages past 2 weeks.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Clear-All-Chats-and-Delete-All-Messages-In-Discord"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Clear-All-Chats-and-Delete-All-Messages-In-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord?"></a>Part 5: How to Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord?</h2><p>In the section above, we talked about deleting messages without using the mouse. That leads us to the possibility of utilizing the ‘AutoHotkey’ script to automate the process.</p><p>Most developers have come up with codes that can delete Discord messages from your account on a mass scale. We’ll be expanding on one of the most popular instances of this: the AutoHotkey script.</p><p>Before you get started with this, you will need an ‘AutoHotkey installer.’ Continue the process by:</p><ol><li>Download and install the ‘AutoHotkey installer’ ;</li><li>Head onto your desktop, right-click and click ‘New’ on the drop-down menu;</li><li>Choose the ‘AutoHotkey script’ and right-click on this file and edit with ‘Notepad’</li><li>Delete everything in the script and paste the following code</li></ol><p><strong><em>t::</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Loop, 100000</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>{</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Up}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, ^a</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {BS}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Enter}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Enter}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>sleep, 100</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Return</em></strong></p><ol><li>Save the file as any name that you wish to</li><li>Once you’ve done that, launch Discord and double-click on the script file</li><li>Open the chat data that you wish to delete and press T</li><li>The script will now delete all the messages</li></ol><p>To stop the script, click on the H icon located on the right side of your taskbar and select Pause Script.</p><p>This is the process by which you can use an ‘Autohotkey script’ to delete messages in bulk. Please note that this option is only available to Windows users as AutoHotkey does not currently work on macOS.</p><p>Ideally, you’ll want the following things from your AutoHotkey script:</p><ol><li>A toggle key for turning it on and off</li><li>The complete keyboard sequence with stops between each step</li></ol><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: you can delete a message you sent, but there’s no saying if the other person took a screenshot before you got around to deleting it. Things on the internet tend to stick around. So, as a safe bet, it’s a good idea to take some time to consider what you wrote before pressing send to avoid any regrets.</p><h4 id="You-May-Also-Interested-In"><a href="#You-May-Also-Interested-In" class="headerlink" title="You May Also Interested In"></a>You May Also Interested In</h4><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Discord Font Generators [Online&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;Android] <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Discord Emoji Makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10+ Best Free Discord Voice Changers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="FAQs-About-Deleting-Discord-Messages"><a href="#FAQs-About-Deleting-Discord-Messages" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Deleting Discord Messages"></a>FAQs About Deleting Discord Messages</h2><h4 id="1-Can-I-Recover-A-Deleted-Message-on-Discord"><a href="#1-Can-I-Recover-A-Deleted-Message-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="1.

At this point, you may be wondering, what does Discord Nitro do?</p><p>Though upgrading is not a requirement as most features do not require a subscription, free users still have certain limitations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-pricing.jpg"                      alt=" Discord Nitro pricing"                ></p><p>For instance, they can’t use the same emojis on two servers. In addition to that, the streaming quality and account customization features also lack on the free plan.

They want more capabilities, and Discord Nitro provides them exactly with that.</p><p>However, most of these new features are cosmetic.</p><p>For instance, <strong>you can make and use your custom emojis if you’re an emoji admirer. Not only this, but you can also use animated emojis, including GIFs</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-benefits.jpg"                      alt=" Discord Nitro benefits"                ></p><p>Without further ado, here are a few key benefits you’ll get with Discord Nitro:</p><h3 id="Better-Emojis"><a href="#Better-Emojis" class="headerlink" title="Better Emojis"></a>Better Emojis</h3><p>We all know how vital emojis have become for healthy chitchats, even to the extent that no conversation seems complete if you don’t have an emoji in it.</p><p><strong>Discord Nitro allows you to collect and create your customized emojis</strong>.

And if you pick a yearly subscription plan, you’ll get a 16% discount.</p><p>The two Discord Nitro variants are Nitro Classic and Nitro!</p><p>If you choose the Nitro classic subscription service, you’ll have to pay $4.99 on the monthly plan or $49.99 annually. This variant is comparatively cheaper than the Nitro and provides stripped-down features.</p><p>On the other hand, if you go for the Nitro subscription service, get ready to pay $99.99 on the yearly plan and $9.99 on the monthly. It offers many features to its users.</p><p>Both these variants provide loads of advantages to discord users; here are a handful of benefits the two paid subscription services offer:</p><ul><li>If you choose the free version, your screen share settings typically max out at the 720p resolution (30fps). However, if you select either of the two paid versions, you can share a screen with friends at 720p (60fps) resolution or 1080p resolution (30fps)</li><li>Go-Live provides users with limited streaming; it means you can stream games to users who don’t happen to be your friends, unlike screen-share. So, with a free version, you can stream at 720p (30fps), whereas, Nitro Classic subscription will allow you to stream up to 1080p resolution (60fps), and the Nitro will provide you with 60fps and more quality</li><li>With the free version, you can upload and share only 8MB size files. But with paid variants, you’ll get an increased uploading limit. For example, Nitro Classic allows an upload limit up to 50MB, while the Nitro goes a step further and allows 100MB</li><li>Users of both paid versions will get a badge which will be displayed with their usernames</li><li>You can upgrade your image to an animated GIF!</li><li>With paid subscriptions, you can create customized usernames and emojis to enhance your experience</li></ul><p>One significant difference between the Nitro and Nitro Classic versions is the difference between their server boost capability.</p><p>Server boost is a user-gifted advantage that paid subscribers can provide to server owners to unlock extra perks for other users. The Nitro service has two server boosts, unlike the Nitro Classic service.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Subscribe-to-Discord-Nitro"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Subscribe-to-Discord-Nitro" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Subscribe to Discord Nitro?"></a>Part 4: How to Subscribe to Discord Nitro?</h2><p>Looking at the perks you get if you become a paid Discord member, it’s evident that several users will want to avail the opportunity.

A unique feature of this platform is that it facilitates community-based communication, where users who share certain interests can form their own private chats that are known as servers.</p><p>While its user interface is quite simple, Discord allows users to deploy a variety of advanced communication tools, from textual content to audio and video streams. It’s natural that users want to express their thoughts creatively, so there is a lot of genuine interest in learning how to change the visual look of the messages through the use of basic text formatting. In this article, we will discuss how to change text style in Discord and provide detailed instructions for activating various options, such as using bold or italic letters or underlining a part of the text.</p><p>Let’s start with the software module that makes it all possible.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#part1">Part 1: How Does Discord Text Engine Work?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Change Text Style in Discord with Markdown?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Use Code Block for Discord Text Formatting?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part5">Part 5: FAQs About Discord Text Formatting</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-How-Does-Discord-Text-Engine-Work"><a href="#Part-1-How-Does-Discord-Text-Engine-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How Does Discord Text Engine Work?"></a>Part 1: How Does Discord Text Engine Work?</h2><p>Beneath the surface, Discord runs on a powerful engine called Markdown, which regulates how text is displayed on the pages visible to users. It’s an application of markup language that completely depends on textual symbols as commands, making it quite simple for users who are not skilled at advanced programming to alter the look of the text.</p><p>Basically, Markdown allows you to enter a few symbols and it will interpret them as commands for changing the text style, for example bolding or underlying certain word or sentence. For highlighting blocks of text, there is a specific library named <a class="link"   href="https://highlightjs.org/" >Highlight.js <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that allows simple text marking for stylistic emphasis.</p><p>This approach is very practical and easy to learn, so long-time users of Discord are able to change text style as they type without thinking too much about it.

Keep in mind that you can easily combine the formatting styles by using multiple commands at the same time.</p><p>Here is an overview of the most important options for changing text style in Discord, and you can preview the text style in real time before sending to friends:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-change-text-style.jpg"                      alt="Change Text Style in Discord  - Basic"                ></p><h4 id="How-to-Bold-Text-in-Discord"><a href="#How-to-Bold-Text-in-Discord" class="headerlink" title="How to Bold Text in Discord?"></a><strong>How to Bold Text in Discord?</strong></h4><p>A simple way to use bold text style is to add two asterisks (**) at the beginning and the end of the text that you want to have this effect.</p><h4 id="How-to-Italicize-in-Discord"><a href="#How-to-Italicize-in-Discord" class="headerlink" title="How to Italicize in Discord?"></a><strong>How to Italicize in Discord?</strong></h4><p>Italicized style of text will be displayed in the chat if you put one asterisk character (*) before and one more after the selected text.</p><h4 id="How-to-Write-Strikethrough-and-Make-Discord-Cross-Out-Text"><a href="#How-to-Write-Strikethrough-and-Make-Discord-Cross-Out-Text" class="headerlink" title="How to Write Strikethrough and Make Discord Cross Out Text?"></a><strong>How to Write Strikethrough and Make Discord Cross Out Text?</strong></h4><p>In order to get a strikethrough effect on your text, you will have to type two tilde characters (~~) on either side of the section of text that you want to change, and then you will create an appearance of a crossed-out portion of text.</p><h4 id="How-to-Make-Discord-Underline-Text"><a href="#How-to-Make-Discord-Underline-Text" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Discord Underline Text?"></a><strong>How to Make Discord Underline Text?</strong></h4><p>Underline effect is also available on Discord and equally simple to activate. Just type two underscore dashes (__)at the start and the ending of the text selection to apply it.</p><h3 id="How-to-Combine-Text-Formatting-Options-in-Discord"><a href="#How-to-Combine-Text-Formatting-Options-in-Discord" class="headerlink" title="How to Combine Text Formatting Options in Discord?"></a>How to Combine Text Formatting Options in Discord?</h3><p>Once you mastered the basic effects and know the commands without thinking, it’s time to consider more complex text transformations that combine more than one effect. In principle, Markdown lets you do this just as easily, for as long as you know all the right combinations of characters that produce the desired effect. Here are the detailed instructions for some of the most frequently utilized combos:</p><h4 id="Underlined-and-Italicized-text"><a href="#Underlined-and-Italicized-text" class="headerlink" title="Underlined and Italicized text"></a>Underlined and Italicized text</h4><p>For this elegant combination, use two underscore dashes (__) followed by one asterisk (*) before and after the selected text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-text.jpg"                      alt="Discord Underlined and Italicized text  "                ></p><h4 id="Underlined-and-Bolded-text"><a href="#Underlined-and-Bolded-text" class="headerlink" title="Underlined and Bolded text"></a>Underlined and Bolded text</h4><p>Put two underscore dashes (__) and add two asterisk characters (**) to both sides of the selection to get those two effects together.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-bolded-text.jpg"                      alt="Discord Underlined and Bolded text  "                ></p><h4 id="Underlined-Italicized-and-Bolded-text"><a href="#Underlined-Italicized-and-Bolded-text" class="headerlink" title="Underlined, Italicized, and Bolded text"></a>Underlined, Italicized, and Bolded text</h4><p>This combination is achieved by placing two underscore marks (__) and three straight asterisks (***) at the beginning as well as the end of the text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-bolded-text.jpg"                      alt="Discord Underlined &amp;  Italicized Bolded  text  "                ></p><h4 id="Bolded-Italicized-underlined-and-crossed-out-text"><a href="#Bolded-Italicized-underlined-and-crossed-out-text" class="headerlink" title="Bolded, Italicized, underlined, and crossed out text"></a>Bolded, Italicized, underlined, and crossed out text</h4><p>You can combine all four style changes as well – just use two tildes (~~), two underscores (__) and three asterisks (***) on either side of your text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-bolded-cross-out-text.jpg"                      alt="Discord Underlined &amp;  Italicized Bolded crossed out text "                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Code-Block-for-Discord-Text-Formatting"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Code-Block-for-Discord-Text-Formatting" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Code Block for Discord Text Formatting?"></a>Part 3: How to Use Code Block for Discord Text Formatting?</h2><p>In addition to simple font transformations, Discord allows users to engage in advanced text formatting with incredible ease. One way to do it is to deploy code blocks, which can be activated with the backtick character ( ` ) placed on the beginning and the end of a text section. This command will highlight the chosen part of the text while preserving blank space around it for extra emphasis of your message. However, if you use three consecutive ( ` ) signs before a block of text and separate the text into several lines by pressing enter, the result will be a series of highlighted lines that form a single code block. This option is simple enough that even beginners with no programming abilities can easily learn how to use it, and it has some practical applications that savvy Discord users are very fond of.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Change-the-Text-Color-in-Discord-Message"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Change-the-Text-Color-in-Discord-Message" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?"></a>Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?</h2><p>It’s not possible to alter the default text color from the native user interface in Discord. However, there is a simple solution to this problem that involves the highlight.is scrip mentioned earlier in the article. This Javascript-based library can transform the normal text into a code block consisting of three lines, where the middle line would be your selection of text in an alternative color. This is a neat workaround that’s very simple to activate using the same kind of text-based commands described above.</p><p>To change the text color, you should create a simple, three-line block. In the top line, you need to put three backtick characters (”’) along with a code phrase corresponding to the text color you would like to use. In the second line, you should type your entire text normally, while the bottom line should include three more backticks. You can create new lines by pressing the Shift and Enter keys at the same time.</p><p>Here is a detailed video tutorial for creating customized text in a range of different colors with all the relevant code phrases.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Discord-Text-Formatting"><a href="#FAQs-About-Discord-Text-Formatting" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Discord Text Formatting"></a>FAQs About Discord Text Formatting</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-the-default-Discord-font"><a href="#1-What-is-the-default-Discord-font" class="headerlink" title="1. What is the default Discord font?"></a>1. What is the default Discord font?</h4><p>Discord uses the same basic font all over the entire platform, including all chats between users and in your profile info. This is Uni sans font, which is quite simple and belongs to the sans serif family of fonts that are known for good readability on almost any background.</p><h4 id="2-How-do-you-get-different-fonts-on-Discord"><a href="#2-How-do-you-get-different-fonts-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="2.

How do you get different fonts on Discord?</h4><p>It’s not possible to change the font directly from the Discord app, but this limitation can be circumvented if you find a good<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Discord font generator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the internet.

How to make a hidden text in Discord?"></a>3. How to make a hidden text in Discord?</h4><p>The creation of a hidden text message that requires direct user action to reveal is possible in Discord and requires a so-called spoiler tag. If you precede your message with the text &#x2F;spoiler or type two slash bars ( &#x2F;&#x2F;) at either side, it will be hidden from other users except for those who decide to view it and indicate their desire by clicking or tapping on it. Messages of this kind appear highlighted with gray background in the message stream on a Discord chat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/expert-tips-securing-seamless-video-sharing-via-discord-channels/"><u>Expert Tips  Securing Seamless Video Sharing via Discord Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-discords-ultimate-selection-of-professional-emoji-makers-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Discord's Ultimate Selection of Professional Emoji Makers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-a-complete-guide-to-personalizing-your-virtual-space-on-discord/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, A Complete Guide to Personalizing Your Virtual Space on Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-craft-strikingly-attractive-pfps-for-your-discolife-in-discord-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How To Craft Strikingly Attractive Pfps for Your DiscoLife in Discord for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/uncovering-the-wonders-of-discord-nitro-free-and-paid-insights-for-2024/"><u>Uncovering the Wonders of Discord Nitro - Free & Paid Insights for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-decoding-the-best-platform-for-real-time-team-collaboration-slack-vs-discord-comparison/"><u>2024 Approved  Decoding the Best Platform for Real-Time Team Collaboration  Slack Vs.

And this isn’t just limited to chatting but sometimes you’re going to want to share content, including videos.</p><p>So, whether it’s a compilation of your best gaming moments that you’ve carefully edited together, a home movie that you want to share with friends, or just a funny clip that someone’s sent you that you want to pass on, here we’ll take you through how to send videos on Discord both on PC and mobile, and the likely issues you might face.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Send Videos on Discord PC</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Send Videos on Discord Mobile</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Send Long Videos on Discord That Are More Than 8MB</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Send-Videos-on-Discord-PC"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Send-Videos-on-Discord-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Send Videos on Discord PC"></a>Part 1: How to Send Videos on Discord PC</h2><p>It’s actually pretty simple to send videos on Discord when using a PC, providing they aren’t too large a file size.</p><p>Firstly, you just need to navigate to the channel or private message where you want to send the video. Just find the right option on the list of servers you’re a member of, or head to your message inbox to find the user you want to send it to privately.</p><p>Once you’re in the right place, click on the plus (+) icon that you’ll find to the left of the chatbox at the bottom of the screen where you’d normally type your message.</p><p>You’ll then just need to find the file on your computer, and double click on it. It’ll then bring up a pop-up for the video where you can add a comment, which will sit above the video (ideal if you need to give context on why you’re sharing it). You can also mark it as a spoiler – useful if you’re sharing a gaming tip but you don’t want to spoil the story for anyone who’s not reached that point yet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/upload-video-discord-1.png"                      alt="upload videos to discord"                ></p><p>From there, it’s as simple as clicking the upload button. Once it’s ready, the video will be in the chat window for anyone in the server to watch, or for your friend if you’ve sent it privately. And if they want to download it, they’ll just need to click the download button (a downward-facing arrow) at the top right of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/upload-video-discord-2.png"                      alt="how to upload videos to discord"                ></p><p>It’s worth noting that, while Discord will play most video formats, it can’t manage everything. If you upload a format that Discord isn’t compatible with, then it won’t show a video player – instead, the file will just be uploaded. Other people can still download it to watch on their own devices.</p><p>Also, there’s a strict file limit of 8MB. This isn’t huge at all – while there’s no definitive file size for video (as it depends on file type, resolution, compression, etc) it’s unlikely to be more than 60 seconds of footage, and could just be a few seconds. If the video you want to upload is more than 8MB, carry on reading below to find out how.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Send-Videos-on-Discord-Mobile"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Send-Videos-on-Discord-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Send Videos on Discord Mobile"></a>Part 2: How to Send Videos on Discord Mobile</h2><p>The process to send video on Discord Mobile is pretty similar both with iOS and Android, but with just a few minor tweaks.</p><p>Firstly, you still need to navigate to either the server or inbox where you want to share the video. You can then click the ‘Photo Selector’ button directly to the left of the chatbox.</p><p>This will open your phone’s gallery, but it’ll only be searching for photos. You instead want the File Selector, which will be the third icon along – it looks like a text document with a folded-over corner.</p><p>Click this and it’ll give you the option to directly upload a video from your phone’s Downloads folder. To send a video that’s stored elsewhere, click on the Expand arrow at the top left of the menu. This will send you to your phone’s file navigation system where you can find the video you want.</p><p>Once you’ve selected the video, just hit the blue Send icon to send your video to the chat. Again you can add a message as a caption, but this time it’ll just be in the normal message box rather than a dedicated comment box before you hit upload.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Send-Long-Videos-on-Discord-That-Are-More-Than-8MB"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Send-Long-Videos-on-Discord-That-Are-More-Than-8MB" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Send Long Videos on Discord That Are More Than 8MB"></a>Part 3: How to Send Long Videos on Discord That Are More Than 8MB</h2><p>So as we’ve said above, there is a file size limit when you’re using a free Discord account of just 8MB, which isn’t much at all. There are a few ways around this, so take your pick from the one that sounds best for you.</p><h4 id="1-Update-to-Discord-Nitro-to-Upload-100MB"><a href="#1-Update-to-Discord-Nitro-to-Upload-100MB" class="headerlink" title="1. Update to Discord Nitro to Upload 100MB"></a>1. Update to Discord Nitro to Upload 100MB</h4><p>The first option is possibly the simplest but it’s definitely not the cheapest, and that’s to pay for an upgrade to Discord Nitro. The paid version of Discord has a number of benefits, one of which is the increased file upload size of 100MB. It costs $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, so if you’re likely to be regularly uploading videos that are lower than this limit, it might make sense.</p><h4 id="2-Cut-Unwanted-Clips-Compress-Video-with-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#2-Cut-Unwanted-Clips-Compress-Video-with-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="2.

Cut Unwanted Clips&#x2F;Compress Video with Filmora Video Editor</h4><p>The second choice would be to take your video and cut it into pieces, sending them one at a time. This might sound time-consuming but with Filmora’s Instant Cutter Tool, it’s really simple.</p><p>All you need to do is open a video in Filmora by clicking the arrow next to Import and then choosing ‘Import with Instant Cutter Tool’.</p><p>This will open the Instant Cutter window where you can click Open File to add your video. From here you can trim your files and export them in multiple sections. There are different ways that you can do this, and while each is a simple process, there are still a few steps to follow.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>For more detail, check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >this post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a step-by-step guide on the different ways you can trim a video in Filmora.</p><p>You can also try to compress your video size, which may let you keep the whole video at the expense of some of the quality. Again, using Filmora, this is easy. But also again, there are different ways to go about it.</p><p>You could literally crop the video in order to trim some of the data, as the reduced viewing screen won’t be as big a file. You can also reduce the resolution, or convert your video to a format that uses fewer data. You’ll need to test it though, as converting to some video formats might result in blurry footage.</p><p>There are advanced settings you can tinker with too, such as lowering the frame rate or the bit rate. Again, rather than go through all of those options in an epic article here, it’s easier to head to a post dedicated to these steps about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >compress videos with Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="3-Upload-to-YouTube-Vimeo-Google-Drive-Dropbox"><a href="#3-Upload-to-YouTube-Vimeo-Google-Drive-Dropbox" class="headerlink" title="3.

Upload to YouTube&#x2F;Vimeo&#x2F;Google Drive&#x2F;Dropbox</h4><p>The final option is to upload your video to an online player or storage site, and link to it, rather than having Discord host the file. YouTube and Vimeo are the obvious options, but Streamable is another popular choice too with a free membership. YouTube’s maximum video uploads are 128GB, which is huge, while other sites like Streamable cap free accounts to 500MB per video.</p><p>So, if you want to upload massive files, you’ll need to decide whether to choose YouTube or pay for an upgraded membership elsewhere. Wherever you host your video, once it’s online just grab the link and paste it into Discord to share your content.</p><p>The only drawback to this option is that it stops other users from being able to download the video directly, and you may need to look at a file sharing alternative such as Dropbox if you want to send the actual file.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Uploading-Videos-to-Discord"><a href="#FAQs-About-Uploading-Videos-to-Discord" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord"></a>FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord</h2><h4 id="Which-Kind-of-Video-Formats-Can-I-Upload-to-Discord"><a href="#Which-Kind-of-Video-Formats-Can-I-Upload-to-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Which Kind of Video Formats Can I Upload to Discord?"></a>Which Kind of Video Formats Can I Upload to Discord?</h4><p>You can send any filetype to another user on Discord, so that they can download it and watch it on their own device. But if you want to upload a video so that Discord embeds it, and makes it playable within the chat, you’re limited to only mp4 and WebM filetypes.</p><p>You can also use MOV files, but not everyone will be able to play them, and FLAC files are supported on desktop only but not on mobile.</p><h4 id="How-Can-I-Upload-Saved-Videos-to-Discord"><a href="#How-Can-I-Upload-Saved-Videos-to-Discord" class="headerlink" title="How Can I Upload Saved Videos to Discord?"></a>How Can I Upload Saved Videos to Discord?</h4><p>If you find a video on Discord that you want to share on a different server or in a private DM, you can use the download icon to save it locally.

In this example we’ll be using Among Us Manager Bot as an example.</p><p>After going to the Website, click the invite link button. Some websites might not have a button to “invite link”. In that case, look for a different button like “invite/add” etc.</p><p>After you click the button, you’ll have to sign in to your discord account and it will then ask which server you wish to add the bot to.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/connect-among-us-manager-to-discord.jpg"                      alt="Connect Among Us Manager  Bot to Discord "                ></p><p>Just select a server and then click continue.</p><p>Next, it’ll ask what permissions you want to give to the bot. Go over this carefully and select the ones you want. But you may lose some functions if a certain permission isn’t given.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/connect-among-us-manager-to-discord-permission-settings.jpg"                      alt="Connect Among Us Manager  Bot to Discord Permission Settings"                ></p><p>Click Authorize. It will then ask you to verify whether you’re human or not. If you pass this little test, the bot will be added to your selected server.</p><p>You can then go over to your server in discord and found your bot there.</p><p>Now all that’s left is getting your friends and hoping into a fun filled and thrilled game of the murder mystery game Among Us.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>In the end, all the Among Us bots are basically used to mute players and unmute them at certain points so that there is no cheating and everyone can play the game fairly and it doesn’t get ruined because of some toxic rotten tomatoes.</p><p><img

You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.</p><p>Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.</p><p>One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Best Screen Recorder Software for Discord Desktop App</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord"></a>Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.</p><h3 id="1-OBS"><a href="#1-OBS" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS"></a>1. OBS</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.</p><p>There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.</p><h3 id="2-Bandicam"><a href="#2-Bandicam" class="headerlink" title="2. Bandicam"></a>2. Bandicam</h3><p>Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.</p><p>Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn’t involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.</p><h3 id="3-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#3-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="3. Wondershare Filmora"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><h3 id="4-DemoCreator"><a href="#4-DemoCreator" class="headerlink" title="4. DemoCreator"></a>4. DemoCreator</h3><p>If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/" >Wondershare DemoCreator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.</p><p>You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.</p><h3 id="5-Camtasia"><a href="#5-Camtasia" class="headerlink" title="5. Camtasia"></a>5. Camtasia</h3><p>If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then <a class="link"   href="https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html" >Camtasia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.</p><p>However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord"></a>Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</h2><p>If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.</p><h3 id="2-Screen-Capture"><a href="#2-Screen-Capture" class="headerlink" title="2. Screen Capture"></a>2. Screen Capture</h3><p>One such option is <a class="link"   href="https://www.screencapture.com/" >Screen Capture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.</p><p>There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.</p><h3 id="3-Clipchamp"><a href="#3-Clipchamp" class="headerlink" title="3. Clipchamp"></a>3. Clipchamp</h3><p>If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer <a class="link"   href="https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/" >Clipchamp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.</p><p>It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.</p><h3 id="3-Screencast-o-matic"><a href="#3-Screencast-o-matic" class="headerlink" title="3. Screencast-o-matic"></a>3. Screencast-o-matic</h3><p>The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is <a class="link"   href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder" >Screencast-o-matic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.</p><p>The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android"><a href="#Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android"></a>Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.</p><h3 id="1-AZ-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#1-AZ-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="1. AZ Screen Recorder"></a>1. AZ Screen Recorder</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >AZ Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.</p><p>It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.</p><h3 id="2-Screen-Recorder-for-Game-Video-Call-Screenshots"><a href="#2-Screen-Recorder-for-Game-Video-Call-Screenshots" class="headerlink" title="2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots"></a>2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots</h3><p>Another option for Android is <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.</p><p>The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.</p><h3 id="3-Record-It"><a href="#3-Record-It" class="headerlink" title="3. Record It"></a>3. Record It</h3><p>If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545" >Record It! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.</p><p>The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Record-Discord-Video-Screen-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Record-Discord-Video-Screen-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</h2><p>If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.</p><p>Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.</p><p>You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.</p><p>If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.</p><p>Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.</p><p>The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-discord-banners-top-picks-for-creation-and-personalized-profile-design/"><u>[New] Discord Banners  Top Picks for Creation & Personalized Profile Design</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-erase-thousands-of-messages-in-just-a-few-clicks-on-discord/"><u>2024 Approved  How to Erase Thousands of Messages in Just a Few Clicks on Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essential-bot-selections-elevate-your-discord-space/"><u>2024 Approved  Essential Bot Selections  Elevate Your Discord Space</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-a-compreenas-guide-to-incorporating-personalized-emojis-in-discord-statuses/"><u>[New] A Compreenas Guide to Incorporating Personalized Emojis in Discord Statuses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-streamlining-communication-essentials-of-discords-video-sharing-feature/"><u>In 2024, Streamlining Communication  Essentials of Discord's Video Sharing Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/unlock-expertise-perfectly-executing-screen-sharing-on-discord-for-2024/"><u>Unlock Expertise  Perfectly Executing Screen Sharing on Discord for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-spruce-up-your-discord-status-with-emojis/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  How to Spruce Up Your Discord Status with Emojis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-preparation-to-beat-giovani-in-pokemon-go-for-vivo-y27s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Preparation to Beat Giovani in Pokemon Go For Vivo Y27s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-make-free-intros-for-youtube-plustemplates/"><u>In 2024, How to Make Free Intros for YouTube?

The process of assigning roles and configuring members is more or less the same across devices. First, you need to create roles and define their authority before assigning these roles to some members.</p><h3 id="How-to-create-roles-in-Discord"><a href="#How-to-create-roles-in-Discord" class="headerlink" title="How to create roles in Discord?"></a>How to create roles in Discord?</h3><p>Before you can assign roles, you need a server. Once you have created your Discord server, start crafting the structure.</p><ol><li>Open your server and right-click on it.</li><li>From the menu that appears, tap server settings.</li><li>Name the role suitably. It should be descriptive of the authority.</li><li>Tap on the plus sign that appears on the top right of the page.</li><li>Here, you can change the title off the roll and even choose the color.</li><li>Now comes the time to grant some permissions. These are basically the authority that you gave to every profile.</li><li>When you are done, save the changes.</li></ol><h3 id="How-to-Assign-Roles-to-Members-in-Discord"><a href="#How-to-Assign-Roles-to-Members-in-Discord" class="headerlink" title="How to Assign Roles to Members in Discord?"></a>How to Assign Roles to Members in Discord?</h3><p>To be able to assign roles, you should first create them</p><ol><li>Once again, hit that right button on your server and go to server settings.</li><li>From the menu that appears to the left, ‘choose members’ under user management.</li><li>Here, you will see the list of all the members on your server, tap the Plus sign that is right beside the username.</li><li>From the drop-down menu that appears, select a role you want to assign to that member.</li><li>You will notice that the color changes as per your settings.

Whenever the server gets crowded, you can create more roles or modify the existing ones. A smaller server can run smoothly with just an admin and an ‘everyone’ role.</p><p>The quickest and easiest way to manage your bloating server is to let all members be ‘everyone’ and adjust permissions accordingly. So, whenever members enter your server, they will automatically be assigned the common role.</p><p>Further, you can easily figure out what roles you have assigned to whom. Due to these colors, the other members can identify moderators, admins, or other roles.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Delete-Roles-in-Discord"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Delete-Roles-in-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Delete Roles in Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Delete Roles in Discord?</h2><p>Honestly, removing Discord roles easier than setting them up. There are hardly a few steps that you need to follow for role removal.</p><ol><li>place the cursor on the server, and hit the right-click.</li><li>From the list, choose server settings. Then click on roles.</li><li>From the roles window, tap on the role that you wish to delete.</li><li>Towards the bottom, you will see the option to delete the role.</li><li>Press ok to confirm.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Add-Roles-on-Discord-Mobile"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Add-Roles-on-Discord-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Add Roles on Discord Mobile?"></a>Part 5: How to Add Roles on Discord Mobile?</h2><p>Like we mentioned earlier, the user interface of Discord is similar across devices. So, there is little difference between the process of creating and managing roles. But it can be baffling for beginners, so here’s a brief!</p><h3 id="1-How-to-create-roles-in-Discord-mobile-app"><a href="#1-How-to-create-roles-in-Discord-mobile-app" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, you can customize this and add the MEE6 bot for automatic role allocation.</p><ol><li>Why can’t I manage the server even I am an admin on the server?</li></ol><p>This is likely to happen if the server owner gave you the role of admin, but the permissions are disabled. You can ask the owner to enable the permissions for your user ID.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-discords-top-10-where-to-date-and-love-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Discord's Top 10  Where to Date and Love for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-deciphering-the-code-of-conduct-your-practical-guide-to-filing-reports-in-online-spaces-like-discord/"><u>In 2024, Deciphering the Code of Conduct  Your Practical Guide to Filing Reports in Online Spaces Like Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-servers-for-romance-discord-edition/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Top Servers for Romance  Discord Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-expert-screenshots-for-discord-enthusiasts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Expert Screenshots for Discord Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-breaking-down-discord-nitro-a-compreehensive-guide-and-steps-for-acquisition/"><u>[New] Breaking Down Discord Nitro  A Compreehensive Guide & Steps for Acquisition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-best-discord-alternatives-you-should-try/"><u>[New] In 2024, Best Discord Alternatives You Should Try</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-hottest-hooks-in-the-crowd-ultimate-discord-nicknames-guide/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Hottest Hooks in the Crowd  Ultimate Discord Nicknames Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/mastering-privacy-settings-a-guide-to-discretion-in-streaming-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Privacy Settings  A Guide to Discretion in Streaming for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-discord-font-generators-onlineiphoneandroid/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Best Discord Font Generators [Online/iPhone/Android]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/leading-custom-font-apps-perfect-for-discord-chat-rooms/"><u>Leading Custom Font Apps - Perfect for Discord Chat Rooms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-creating-stunning-instagram-profile-screenshots-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Creating Stunning Instagram Profile Screenshots for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/revolutionize-slack-discussions-with-10-free-recorders-for-2024/"><u>Revolutionize Slack Discussions with 10 Free Recorders for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/google-play-services-wont-update-12-fixes-are-here-on-oppo-reno-9a-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Google Play Services Wont Update?

It is not a sophisticated tool, but it does everything right. It would be nice if it had more voices or features but it is not a big problem.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><p>It is freeware and doesn’t require a free subscription or account sign-in</p><p>Works for all versions of windows</p><p>Setup is pretty easy and fast</p><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><p>There are no added voice effects except the custom pitch function</p><p>Some voices make certain accents difficult to understand</p><p>Has a limited girl voice changer for discord</p><h4 id="2-MorphVOX"><a href="#2-MorphVOX" class="headerlink" title="2.

It may have made it to the top of this list if it didn’t restrict so many of its features to the paid version. The free version is good, but it pales in comparison to the paid process version.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><p>Uses very little bandwidth and CPU power</p><p>Has sound effects you can throw into the mix</p><p>Custom shortcuts make using this tool easier</p><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><p>Paid subscription version is very expensive</p><p>The interface shape looks weird and clunky</p><p>Slightly unintuitive install process</p><h4 id="3-VoiceMod"><a href="#3-VoiceMod" class="headerlink" title="3.

If you are using this program to change your voice in real time, then it sounds good. If you are using it to change your recorded voice, then it sounds amazing. In fact, if this article were about finding a voice changer for recorded voices, rather than finding a free voice changer for discord live chat, then VoiceMod would win by a significant amount.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><p>The voices you produce sound great</p><p>Professionally designed and easy to installs</p><p>Flexible with plenty of uses</p><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><p>The free version locks off too many features</p><p>App and website needs proofreading for its many written mistakes</p><p>Seems to hide paid version until you have actually downloaded</p><h4 id="4-Voxal-Voice-Changer"><a href="#4-Voxal-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="4.

Installing cleanly is seemingly could be easier, and the program is not difficult to use. However, the free version is very limited. Many of the voices and many of the voice-manipulation tools are locked off from free users.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><p>Has a low CPU usage</p><p>The interface is pretty easy to understand</p><p>Add effects to live and recorded voices</p><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><p>Compatibility with Steam games is hit and miss</p><p>Clean ad-free installs of the free version is tricky</p><p>Some voices sound too similar to bother with</p><h4 id="5-Discord-Voice-Changer"><a href="#5-Discord-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="5.

The sad part is that this tool is tricky to find, especially if you want a non-Android version. This is because the tool doesn’t have its own website, so numerous websites seem to hold it, but they are not easy websites to find.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><p>Connecting with Discord is very easy</p><p>Picking a voice is simple and fast</p><p>Very low CPU usage</p><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><p>Difficult to install</p><p>Finding stable or reliable versions can be tricky</p><p>The developer Ovia Games is out of business</p><h4 id="6-Super-Voice-Changer"><a href="#6-Super-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="6.

But, that shouldn’t dissuade you from using it because it has three voices that you can warp and manipulate. The level at which you can manipulate them is very deep. Play with the settings until you find the voice you like, and then save your settings for next time.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><p>Allows for fairly deep customization</p><p>Save your settings for easy use next time</p><p>Loads quickly and doesn’t use much CPU power</p><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><p>Tricky to install correctly</p><p>Needs a better help section</p><p>Difficult to figure out what some functions do</p><h4 id="7-Audio-for-Fun"><a href="#7-Audio-for-Fun" class="headerlink" title="7.

If you are looking for something simple and quick, then pick a free open-source program. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to help you record and change your voice, then consider a program that has added paid versions.</p><ol><li><strong>What Operation System You Use? Windows, Mac, or More</strong></li></ol><p>The voice changer for Discord Mac versions are a little less common on the Internet. If you are a Mac user, then consider sticking to the app offerings on Apple-moderated marketplaces. Changing your voice for Discord isn’t a difficult task, so you should probably stay clear from paid programs if you are a Mac user.</p><ol><li><strong>What Voice Effects Do You Want?</strong></li></ol><p>If you are looking for a female voice changer for Discord, then mostly every voice changer will suit you. Every app&#x2F;program listed on this article has a female voice version. The reason for this is because a female voice is often considered higher pitched and lighter, and such a tone is available through all the apps&#x2F;programs listed above.</p><ol><li><strong>Is It Easy to Get the Tool to Work?</strong></li></ol><p>If you are having a hard time getting the voice changer to work with Discord, then take a look online and especially on YouTube. There are often users on YouTube who have had the same problem and who are showing off a new solution.</p><p>If you are really struggling to find a solution, then look for ways to get pre-recorded content into Discord. Usually, the people who offer solutions on Google and Bing to this problem will also have the solution to getting your funny voice changer to work with Discord.</p><ol><li><strong>Does it Have a Free Trial?</strong></li></ol><p>One of the primary reasons why shouldn’t pay for a voice changer, at least at first, is because there is no guarantee that program will work. It is better if you download and try a free version or use a free trial. That way, if it doesn’t work, you haven’t lost anything.</p><p>Do not be fooled into thinking you have to pay for each tool. Many voice changers will make it seem like their only options are paid versions, but this is often not the case. Even those that do not have a free version will often have a free trial that you can exploit.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-Rating-the-Free-Voice-Changers"><a href="#Conclusion-Rating-the-Free-Voice-Changers" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion - Rating the Free Voice Changers"></a>Conclusion - Rating the Free Voice Changers</h2><p>Since each of the tools on this article are free, there is nothing stopping you from downloading all of them and trying each one. Just be sure you are downloading from a reliable and safe place because some websites host malicious downloads that are not what they say they are.</p><p>You may also have a few problems in terms of compatibility. For example, some will only work on Windows devices, or iOS devices, or on Android devices. Though none of the programs listed in this article are iOS only.</p><p>Are you a fan of one or more free voice changer for discord?

If your server has many members in it, it is wiser to transfer the ownership rather than shutting the server completely or abandoning it to fate. Especially if the users are active, then you can handover the ownership to a trustworthy person.</p><p>Here is how you can do it -</p><p><strong>For desktop</strong></p><p>The process is quite simple and only takes a few minutes.</p><ol><li>Open the Discord app or log in using the browser.</li><li>Click on the server that you want to leave.</li><li>With right-click, open up the floating menu.</li><li>From that list, select server settings and then choose members.</li><li>Select the user that You Want To handover your server to. Tap those 3 dots and tap on ‘transfer ownership.’</li><li>Confirm your choice and then click on transfer ownership.</li><li>The chosen member will become the new owner of the server.</li></ol><p><strong>On mobile</strong></p><p>The transfer procedure is quite similar to the desktop version. However, it has a few extra steps.</p><ol><li>Open your Discord App on your phone.</li><li>Select the server that you want to give away.</li><li>Tap those 3 dots to open up the menu. Under user management, tap on ‘members.’</li><li>Select the member that will be the new owner of your server. Tap the 3 dots that appear next to the name of that user.</li><li>A confirmation box will appear.</li><li>Check off the box to confirm your choice.</li></ol><p>Your server is now successfully transferred to the selected member. And the new owner can decide what to do with the server.</p><p>FAQs About Leaving A Discord Server</p><ol><li>How can I leave a Discord server without anyone knowing?</li></ol><p>Frankly speaking, there is no magic to help conceal your disappearance from a server. There is no way to hide your departure. However, you can take a few measures to make it less noticeable.</p><ul><li>Lay low for a few hours or days. This won’t work if you are the loudest member on the server. But still, it’s worth a shot.</li><li>Try changing your avatar, profile picture, and nickname. This can throw people off the track or confuse them for a while.</li><li>Control yourself and try not to tell anyone that you are leaving.</li><li>And now it’s time for the discreet farewell!</li></ul><p>You might still get some texts on personal asking about your exit. This is not a surefire way of making your exit a secret. However, hundreds of members along with bots will make your disappearance less apparent. Another solution would be to create a new user ID and leave the old one inactive.</p><ol><li>Does leaving a Discord server delete your messages?</li></ol><p>No, none of the texts that you sent on the server get deleted. Every text remains, even after you leave. The only way you can delete your texts if you delete them all one by one, or someone with sufficient permissions deletes them. If you get banned, then the member who banned you decides whether to keep your messages on the server or remove them. In this case, your texts can be removed if the member deletes them.</p><p>This was a guide on ‘<strong>how to leave a Discord server’</strong> that provided a detailed how-to on leaving servers and transferring servers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/how-to-establish-and-run-a-discochannel-successfully/"><u>How to Establish and Run a DiscoChannel Successfully</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-interaction-select-the-right-bots-for-your-space-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Interaction  Select the Right Bots for Your Space for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-how-to-perfectly-incorinate-emojis-into-your-discord-users-statuses/"><u>[New] How to Perfectly Incorinate Emojis Into Your Discord User's Statuses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-the-art-of-emoji-inclusion-in-discord-user-statements/"><u>In 2024, Mastering the Art of Emoji Inclusion in Discord User Statements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-premiered-5-stunning-social-media-logos-in-action/"><u>In 2024, Premiered 5 Stunning Social Media Logos in Action</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-get-free-animated-emojis-on-discord-withwithout-nitro/"><u>[New] In 2024, How to Get Free Animated Emojis on Discord [With/Without Nitro]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-top-non-discord-streaming-networks/"><u>[Updated] Top Non-Discord Streaming Networks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-explorers-blueprint-how-to-unearth-hidden-discord-communities-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Explorer's Blueprint  How to Unearth Hidden Discord Communities for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-discords-digital-portraiture/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to Discord's Digital Portraiture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-join-the-discord-emoji-revolution-with-free-resources-here/"><u>2024 Approved  Join the Discord Emoji Revolution with Free Resources Here</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-your-snap-chronicles-await-over-120-ideas-to-craft-personal-and-distinctive-story-titles-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Your Snap Chronicles Await  Over 120 Ideas to Craft Personal and Distinctive Story Titles for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/updated-free-video-splitter-software-top-rated-options-for-2024/"><u>Updated Free Video Splitter Software Top-Rated Options for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/mastering-switch-saving-gameplay-footage/"><u>Mastering Switch  Saving Gameplay Footage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-download-8-best-audio-spectrum-templates-for-video/"><u>New In 2024, Download 8 Best Audio Spectrum Templates for Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-tools-for-efficient-video-capture-on-windows-11/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Top Tools for Efficient Video Capture on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-streamlining-virtual-screen-display-in-google-meet-chats/"><u>[New] Streamlining Virtual Screen Display in Google Meet Chats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-tutorial-how-to-bypass-vivo-v27-pro-frp-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Step-by-Step Tutorial How To Bypass Vivo V27 Pro FRP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-streampulse-app-testimonials/"><u>[New] StreamPulse App Testimonials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-create-neon-text-like-a-pro-top-online-tools-and-resources/"><u>New 2024 Approved Create Neon Text Like a Pro Top Online Tools and Resources</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/viral-cuisine-discover-the-top-15-most-popular-tiktok-food-videos-yet-for-2024/"><u>Viral Cuisine  Discover the Top 15 Most Popular TikTok Food Videos Yet for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Since Discord serves to enable groups of friends or people with shared interests to communicate in real-time, standing out from the crowd and establishing a well-known and well-liked persona can be very challenging. Every element of presence on the platform contributes to the overall impression the user will make, and his profile picture is definitely one of the most impactful elements that go a long way towards identity building.</p><p><em><strong>It’s important to note that Discord users can only use a single profile picture or avatar on the platform, and can’t switch them from one server to another.</strong></em> This rule serves to establish some accountability and familiarity and applies even to server administrators. With that in mind, choosing a great image to represent you everywhere on the Discord platform is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly. To help you do this the right way while respecting all the rules, we prepared a detailed guide for this process.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#part1">Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part2">Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Create A Discord Avatar in Filmora?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part5">Part 5: Frequently Asked Questions About Discord PFP</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance"><a href="#Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance"></a>Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</h2><p>Like all other social networks and online communication services, Discord has a set of rules determining whether a certain image is suitable for use as an avatar.</p><p>First of all, you have to adhere to a size limit for technical reasons, as too large images would slow down the channel. On the other hand, too small images won’t be legible and can look bad due to pixelization. The most optimal image size you should use for your Discord profile photo is at least <strong>512 x 512 pixels</strong> – enough to be clearly visible and far above the <strong>180 x 180-pixel minimum</strong>.</p><p>You don’t have to use your real photo or likeness for your Discord avatar – in fact, you don’t have to use a realistic image at all. Discord allows the use of photographs as well as various types of illustrations and cartoon images and accepts JPG as well as the animated GIF format.</p><p>This gives you a lot of freedom to craft your new identity and uses some powerful imagery, either created from scratch or taken from the internet. However, there are still some community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your submission for a profile picture might be rejected for failing to meet Discord’s T&amp;C.</p><p>Basically, no NSFW images are allowed on Discord so you will have to avoid anything extreme or controversial. Pornographic content or explicit nudity is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions or promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality. You also need to stay away from violent imagery or anything depicting illegal activity, including drug use, racial discrimination, or mistreatment of animals. While this eliminates a lot of content, it still leaves enough room to express yourself freely without risking offending any other Discord users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-Download"><a href="#Part-2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-Download" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download"></a>Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download</h2><p>If you want to download a cool Discord profile picture, you can check the following websites:</p><h4 id="1-discordavatars-com"><a href="#1-discordavatars-com" class="headerlink" title="1. discordavatars.com"></a>1. discordavatars.com</h4><p>This website collects free Discord avatars and profile pictures, which allow you to download without any limitations. You can search for a Discord avatar on the search bar or find it from the popular tags on the side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discordavatars-profile-picture-download.jpg"                      alt="download filmora PFP from discordavatar.com"                ></p><p> Besides Discord PFP downloading, you can also find some resources and tips about Discord on this website.</p><h4 id="2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-and-Server-Icons-from-woodpunchsgraphics-com"><a href="#2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-and-Server-Icons-from-woodpunchsgraphics-com" class="headerlink" title="2.

Discord Profile Pictures and Server Icons from woodpunchsgraphics.com</h4><p>This website provides both regular non-animated and animated profile pictures for Discord, but as you may all know, you can only add an animated profile when you subscribed to Discord Nitro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-profile-pictures-server-icons-template-customize.jpg"                      alt="Discord Profile Pictures and Server Icons templates"                ></p><p>There are limited Discord profile picture and server icon templates on this website, and you should customize the color and text, and submit your email to purchase.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-A-Discord-Avatar-in-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-A-Discord-Avatar-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Create A Discord Avatar in Filmora?"></a>Part 3: How to Create A Discord Avatar in Filmora?</h2><p>Many Discord users ultimately decide to create custom profile pictures using external visual tools, and this option is highly recommended to anyone with at least basic creative skills. It doesn’t take too much effort to make a fantastic avatar that will be completely unique and tell exactly the story you want. There are many different software tools you can use for this purpose, but since the task is very simple you can use a practical, free program such as Filmora.</p><p>The procedure of creating a profile picture for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complex and involves just a few simple steps.</p><p>You should start by identifying the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be an animated character or a real-life photo. You can search on Google image or download it from some discord profile sites.</p><p>Next, you need to load the selected image into a new project, and then resize the image to fit the preferred dimensions for Discord and change its shape to circular. To change the shape, go to Effects -&gt; Utility -&gt; Image Mask to optimize the image for a Discord avatar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-overlay-image-mask-discord-profile-wondershare-filmora.jpg"                      alt="create discord avatar with Filmora"                ></p><p>By adding overlays on top of the basic image, you can also introduce any visual or textual elements that will personalize the avatar even further. To get maximum attention, you might want to use a video or animation as part of the avatar – just add them to overlays and save your file as GIF. Since Discord allows GIF format, you can get an avatar that literally jumps off the page in every chat that you are a part of and elicits a strong reaction from those who see it.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Change-My-Profile-Picture-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Change-My-Profile-Picture-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?</h2><p>After you successfully created a profile image that you are completely satisfied with, it’s time to upload it to Discord and start using it as your avatar in all your chats. However, this is not done in the same way on different platforms, so you will need to follow the instructions for the type of system you normally use to access your Discord account.</p><h3 id="How-to-Change-Avatars-on-Discord-Desktop-Computer"><a href="#How-to-Change-Avatars-on-Discord-Desktop-Computer" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Avatars on Discord Desktop Computer?"></a>How to Change Avatars on Discord Desktop Computer?</h3><p>Open your Discord app (Mac or Windows version) and look for a gear icon in the bottom left corner of your screen. Clicking on this icon will take you to the User settings menu, where you need to find the My Account tab.</p><p>Next, hover with your mouse cursor over the current profile picture, then click on the icon that appears right next to it. This action will let you upload an image (JPG or GIF) from your hard drive and make it your new profile picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-discord-profile-avatar.jpg"                      alt="change discord avatar"                ></p><p>Keep in mind that Discord will automatically crop images that are not already in a circular format, so you need to make sure that the image is well centered before uploading.</p><h3 id="How-to-Change-Discord-Avatars-on-Mobile-Devices"><a href="#How-to-Change-Discord-Avatars-on-Mobile-Devices" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Discord Avatars on Mobile Devices?"></a>How to Change Discord Avatars on Mobile Devices?</h3><p>The procedure for changing the profile avatar on Discord from a mobile device is equally straightforward, and it’s similar on both Android and iOS phones. After you open the app, you need to tap on the icon in the right bottom corner to access the Account menu.</p><p>Find the profile picture in the screen that opens, and tap on it to access your phone gallery, then choose the image you would like to use for identification on Discord. It will automatically be uploaded and replace the current image as your only avatar on all Discord channels until it’s changed again.</p><h2 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Profile-Pictures-on-Discord"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Profile-Pictures-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Frequently Asked Questions About Profile Pictures on Discord"></a>Frequently Asked Questions About Profile Pictures on Discord</h2><h4 id="1-Why-can’t-I-change-my-profile-picture-on-Discord"><a href="#1-Why-can’t-I-change-my-profile-picture-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="1. Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?"></a>1. Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?</h4><p>If you experience this problem, it’s most likely a consequence of trying to make too many picture changes too fast. While Discord will allow you to upload two profile images in rapid succession, the third attempt within a few minutes is going to be unsuccessful. The problem will disappear if you wait for a short period of time and try uploading again. Another reason might be that your firewall is preventing you from using an image from a cloud server, but you can easily bypass the issue and download the picture first to your hard disc before uploading it to Discord from there.</p><h4 id="2-How-can-I-find-my-old-profile-picture"><a href="#2-How-can-I-find-my-old-profile-picture" class="headerlink" title="2. How can I find my old profile picture?"></a>2. How can I find my old profile picture?</h4><p>All of the images you previously used as Discord avatars remain memorized and can be reactivated at any time. You can find this collection of images on a specific portion of your profile page, so if you want to use any of them you can simply click on them without having to go through the regular upload process all over again.</p><h4 id="3-What-do-the-colored-dots-next-to-my-profile-picture-mean"><a href="#3-What-do-the-colored-dots-next-to-my-profile-picture-mean" class="headerlink" title="3. What do the colored dots next to my profile picture mean?"></a>3. What do the colored dots next to my profile picture mean?</h4><p>Those dots indicate the current status of the user, with each color having a fixed meaning. If you see a green dot, the user is available to chat at the moment. A yellow dot indicated an idle user that hasn’t been active in a while, and the red color means the user is busy and doesn’t want to be disturbed. Finally, a gray dot confirms that the user is currently not signed in to his Discord account.</p><h4 id="4-Can-I-use-different-avatars-on-different-Discord-servers"><a href="#4-Can-I-use-different-avatars-on-different-Discord-servers" class="headerlink" title="4. Can I use different avatars on different Discord servers?"></a>4. Can I use different avatars on different Discord servers?</h4><p>Unfortunately, this is not possible to do. While Discord lets you use multiple nicknames on different servers, every member (including admins) can have just one avatar on Discord at any given time.</p><h4 id="5-How-can-I-download-someone’s-profile-icon-in-Discord"><a href="#5-How-can-I-download-someone’s-profile-icon-in-Discord" class="headerlink" title="5.

From gaming to just general chatting, it is used by everyone. Discord also provides bots and features to expand the user’s experience.

Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.</p><p><strong>Discord music bots</strong> provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time. Discord music bots can find songs on YouTube, Spotify, or other platforms and play them on a Discord voice channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora box"                ></p><p>Filmora Discord Video Editor</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora - Discord Video Editor"></a>Wondershare Filmora - <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Discord Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>• Create videos for Discord with a smaller size due to the 8MB restriction</p><p>• Edit audio files like denoise, crop, audio ducking, audio auto synchronization, etc…</p><p>• Cross-platform supported - (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord"></a>Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord</h2><h3 id="1-Probot"><a href="#1-Probot" class="headerlink" title="1.

Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.</p><p>This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.</p><p>Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.</p><p>After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members’ area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?</h2><p>Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.</p><p>Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type <em>–help</em> for Groovy and similarly for every other bot ([specified prefix]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.</p><p>Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.</p><p>You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the <em>–loop track</em> command. And loop your whole queue using –<em>loop queue</em>. You can turn the loop off by –<em>loop off</em>.</p><p>If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the <em>–queue</em> command.</p><p>In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?"></a>Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?</h2><p>Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmore Discord video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size.

Introduced originally for gamers, it now has become a platform for all types of communities who want video calls, voice chats, video streaming, and more.</p><p>It’s arguably one of the best and most popular apps among the global gaming community. Though it’s free to use, you need a paid subscription plan to unlock its full potential like almost all other online services available.</p><p>The premium subscription service for Discord is known as Discord Nitro! Want to learn more about it? Read on as we elaborate.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Discord Nitro?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Why Should People Use The Discord Nitro?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How Much Does Discord Nitro Cost??</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Subscribe to Discord Nitro?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How to Get Discord Nitro for Free?</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Part 6: When People should Use Discord Nitro?</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Discord-Nitro-And-What-Does-It-Do"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Discord-Nitro-And-What-Does-It-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Discord Nitro And What Does It Do?"></a>Part 1: What Is Discord Nitro And What Does It Do?</h2><p>Discord is absolutely free, but you may require a Discord Nitro subscription if you want to use its more powerful features! At this point, you may be wondering, what does Discord Nitro do?</p><p>Though upgrading is not a requirement as most features do not require a subscription, free users still have certain limitations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-pricing.jpg"                      alt=" Discord Nitro pricing"                ></p><p>For instance, they can’t use the same emojis on two servers. In addition to that, the streaming quality and account customization features also lack on the free plan. These features and more are strictly for Discord Nitro users only.</p><p>Apart from the fact that Discord Nitro offers better additional features, it also lets users help their preferred servers and unlock various features.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-People-Use-The-Discord-Nitro"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-People-Use-The-Discord-Nitro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Should People Use The Discord Nitro?"></a>Part 2: Why Should People Use The Discord Nitro?</h2><p>With the discord free version, you can do many things: <strong>communicate with your friend outside and inside of games, start your server, and even participate in various channels</strong>.</p><p>For some, these features are more than adequate; for others, they aren’t! They want more capabilities, and Discord Nitro provides them exactly with that.</p><p>However, most of these new features are cosmetic.</p><p>For instance, <strong>you can make and use your custom emojis if you’re an emoji admirer. Not only this, but you can also use animated emojis, including GIFs</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-benefits.jpg"                      alt=" Discord Nitro benefits"                ></p><p>Without further ado, here are a few key benefits you’ll get with Discord Nitro:</p><h3 id="Better-Emojis"><a href="#Better-Emojis" class="headerlink" title="Better Emojis"></a>Better Emojis</h3><p>We all know how vital emojis have become for healthy chitchats, even to the extent that no conversation seems complete if you don’t have an emoji in it.</p><p><strong>Discord Nitro allows you to collect and create your customized emojis</strong>. Usually, these emojis are animated and easily used while chatting with other Discord users.</p><h3 id="Personal-Profile"><a href="#Personal-Profile" class="headerlink" title="Personal Profile"></a>Personal Profile</h3><p>Since your personal profile is your only Discord identity, make sure to customize it with animated avatars and claim custom tags to get going.</p><h3 id="Better-Animation"><a href="#Better-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Better Animation"></a>Better Animation</h3><p>With Discord Nitro, you can also unblock various GIF avatars and custom tags.</p><h3 id="High-Definition-HD-Screen-Sharing"><a href="#High-Definition-HD-Screen-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="High-Definition (HD) Screen Sharing"></a>High-Definition (HD) Screen Sharing</h3><p>You can share the game screen on the server or with friends and other users with Discord Nitro. Choose from 720p and 1080p at 30fps.</p><h3 id="Fancy-Badge"><a href="#Fancy-Badge" class="headerlink" title="Fancy Badge"></a>Fancy Badge</h3><p>One of the better additions for several Discord users is getting the latest, fancy badge. <strong>With Discord Nitro, you can earn new badges to display on your personal profile</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Much-Does-Discord-Nitro-Cost"><a href="#Part-3-How-Much-Does-Discord-Nitro-Cost" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Much Does Discord Nitro Cost?"></a>Part 3: How Much Does Discord Nitro Cost?</h2><p>Free Discord users can choose from two variants if they want to switch to Discord Nitro premium services.</p><p>You can choose between annual or monthly subscription plans. And if you pick a yearly subscription plan, you’ll get a 16% discount.</p><p>The two Discord Nitro variants are Nitro Classic and Nitro!</p><p>If you choose the Nitro classic subscription service, you’ll have to pay $4.99 on the monthly plan or $49.99 annually. This variant is comparatively cheaper than the Nitro and provides stripped-down features.</p><p>On the other hand, if you go for the Nitro subscription service, get ready to pay $99.99 on the yearly plan and $9.99 on the monthly. It offers many features to its users.</p><p>Both these variants provide loads of advantages to discord users; here are a handful of benefits the two paid subscription services offer:</p><ul><li>If you choose the free version, your screen share settings typically max out at the 720p resolution (30fps). However, if you select either of the two paid versions, you can share a screen with friends at 720p (60fps) resolution or 1080p resolution (30fps)</li><li>Go-Live provides users with limited streaming; it means you can stream games to users who don’t happen to be your friends, unlike screen-share. So, with a free version, you can stream at 720p (30fps), whereas, Nitro Classic subscription will allow you to stream up to 1080p resolution (60fps), and the Nitro will provide you with 60fps and more quality</li><li>With the free version, you can upload and share only 8MB size files. But with paid variants, you’ll get an increased uploading limit. For example, Nitro Classic allows an upload limit up to 50MB, while the Nitro goes a step further and allows 100MB</li><li>Users of both paid versions will get a badge which will be displayed with their usernames</li><li>You can upgrade your image to an animated GIF!</li><li>With paid subscriptions, you can create customized usernames and emojis to enhance your experience</li></ul><p>One significant difference between the Nitro and Nitro Classic versions is the difference between their server boost capability.</p><p>Server boost is a user-gifted advantage that paid subscribers can provide to server owners to unlock extra perks for other users. The Nitro service has two server boosts, unlike the Nitro Classic service.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Subscribe-to-Discord-Nitro"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Subscribe-to-Discord-Nitro" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Subscribe to Discord Nitro?"></a>Part 4: How to Subscribe to Discord Nitro?</h2><p>Looking at the perks you get if you become a paid Discord member, it’s evident that several users will want to avail the opportunity. Especially with the number of streamers and gamers increasing every day!</p><p>But how does one upgrade to Discord Nitro?</p><p>It’s quite straightforward to get a paid subscription plan with Discord.

The sad part is that this tool is tricky to find, especially if you want a non-Android version. This is because the tool doesn’t have its own website, so numerous websites seem to hold it, but they are not easy websites to find.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><p>Connecting with Discord is very easy</p><p>Picking a voice is simple and fast</p><p>Very low CPU usage</p><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><p>Difficult to install</p><p>Finding stable or reliable versions can be tricky</p><p>The developer Ovia Games is out of business</p><h4 id="6-Super-Voice-Changer"><a href="#6-Super-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="6.

But, that shouldn’t dissuade you from using it because it has three voices that you can warp and manipulate. The level at which you can manipulate them is very deep. Play with the settings until you find the voice you like, and then save your settings for next time.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><p>Allows for fairly deep customization</p><p>Save your settings for easy use next time</p><p>Loads quickly and doesn’t use much CPU power</p><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><p>Tricky to install correctly</p><p>Needs a better help section</p><p>Difficult to figure out what some functions do</p><h4 id="7-Audio-for-Fun"><a href="#7-Audio-for-Fun" class="headerlink" title="7.

The interface is pretty intuitive to most tech-savvy people.</p><p>Pros</p><p>The voice morphing tools are pretty advanced</p><p>Has various paid and free trial options for flexibility</p><p>You can customize the settings for a better output quality</p><p>Cons</p><p>The three paid versions are unfairly priced</p><p>Many functions on this tool will not be used by Discord users</p><p>Needs a strong tutorial section</p><h4 id="8-RoboVox-Voice-Changer"><a href="#8-RoboVox-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="8.

If you are looking for something simple and quick, then pick a free open-source program. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to help you record and change your voice, then consider a program that has added paid versions.</p><ol><li><strong>What Operation System You Use? Windows, Mac, or More</strong></li></ol><p>The voice changer for Discord Mac versions are a little less common on the Internet. If you are a Mac user, then consider sticking to the app offerings on Apple-moderated marketplaces. Changing your voice for Discord isn’t a difficult task, so you should probably stay clear from paid programs if you are a Mac user.</p><ol><li><strong>What Voice Effects Do You Want?</strong></li></ol><p>If you are looking for a female voice changer for Discord, then mostly every voice changer will suit you. Every app&#x2F;program listed on this article has a female voice version. The reason for this is because a female voice is often considered higher pitched and lighter, and such a tone is available through all the apps&#x2F;programs listed above.</p><ol><li><strong>Is It Easy to Get the Tool to Work?</strong></li></ol><p>If you are having a hard time getting the voice changer to work with Discord, then take a look online and especially on YouTube. There are often users on YouTube who have had the same problem and who are showing off a new solution.</p><p>If you are really struggling to find a solution, then look for ways to get pre-recorded content into Discord. Usually, the people who offer solutions on Google and Bing to this problem will also have the solution to getting your funny voice changer to work with Discord.</p><ol><li><strong>Does it Have a Free Trial?</strong></li></ol><p>One of the primary reasons why shouldn’t pay for a voice changer, at least at first, is because there is no guarantee that program will work. It is better if you download and try a free version or use a free trial. That way, if it doesn’t work, you haven’t lost anything.</p><p>Do not be fooled into thinking you have to pay for each tool. Many voice changers will make it seem like their only options are paid versions, but this is often not the case. Even those that do not have a free version will often have a free trial that you can exploit.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-Rating-the-Free-Voice-Changers"><a href="#Conclusion-Rating-the-Free-Voice-Changers" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion - Rating the Free Voice Changers"></a>Conclusion - Rating the Free Voice Changers</h2><p>Since each of the tools on this article are free, there is nothing stopping you from downloading all of them and trying each one.

Although it was made for gamers, it is readily used for communicating in offices, during projects, or for professional collaboration.</p><p>Even though it’s straightforward to use, there are several Discord features that you may be unfamiliar with.</p><p>One such feature is called pinning messages. It is available to moderators, administrators, server owners, and other users who have permission to “Manage Messages” in various server channels.</p><p>This feature helps you find and share vital messages quickly, especially when new users join a specific channel.</p><p>It acts like a sticky note for Discord, making sure valuable information such as server rules do not get overshadowed by new messages even months after the pinned messages are first posted.</p><p>Today, we will go over how to pin a message on Discord for your desktop app on PC and Mac, as well as on your iPhone and Android mobile devices.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Pin-A-Message-on-Discord-Desktop"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Pin-A-Message-on-Discord-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Pin A Message on Discord Desktop?"></a>Part 1: How to Pin A Message on Discord Desktop?</h2><p>If you want to learn how to pin messages on Discord desktop, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Hover over any message which you wish to pin.</li><li>On the right-hand side of it, there will be a button that would read as More; click it and you will see a screen like below</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pin-messages-on-discord.jpg"                      alt=" Pin message on Discord"                ></p><ol><li>Now, click on the “Pin Message” option</li><li>After which, you will be presented with a prompt asking you to confirm that you want to pin this particular message. Click on “Oh yeah, pin it.”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/double-check-pin-messages.jpg"                      alt=" Pin message on Discord"                ></p><p>That’s it! You have now learned how to pin messages on Discord for the desktop application.</p><p>But make sure you don’t pin everything that might seem important at a glance — only pin messages that may have utility in the future.</p><p>Also, don’t pin messages that are just important for you. In larger channels, prioritize pinning messages that will benefit most participants.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Pin-Messages-on-Discord-Mobile-App"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Pin-Messages-on-Discord-Mobile-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Pin Messages on Discord Mobile App?"></a>Part 2: How to Pin Messages on Discord Mobile App?</h2><p>Pinning messages in the mobile app is very similar to how it is done on the desktop application. Do it by:</p><ol><li>Just hold down your finger on the message you wish to pin</li><li>A couple of seconds later, you will be presented with a list of options</li><li>From here, click on “Pin Message”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pin-message-on-discord-mobile.jpg"                      alt=" Pin message on Discord mobile"                ></p><ol><li>A pop-up will appear confirming if you want to pin the message. If you are sure you want to pin a particular message, tap the “Yes” button and then your message is pinned</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-View-Pinned-Messages-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-View-Pinned-Messages-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to View Pinned Messages on Discord"></a>Part 3: How to View Pinned Messages on Discord</h2><p>Accessing pinned messages is just as easy as pinning them. To access a pinned message on the app’s desktop version:</p><ol><li>Click on the pin icon appearing on the top right-hand side of your screen</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-pinned-message.jpg"                      alt="view Pinned message on Discord"                ></p><ol><li>Doing this will present you with a drop-down list of pinned messages. Now, you can tap on the “Jump” button next to the “x” (cross) icon to go directly to the pinned message</li><li>This will allow you to understand the context behind the pinned message. You can also access and share links in the pinned messages from here</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-View-Pinned-Messages-on-Discord-Mobile"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-View-Pinned-Messages-on-Discord-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to View Pinned Messages on Discord Mobile"></a>Part 4: How to View Pinned Messages on Discord Mobile</h2><p>View your pins on the mobile version of Discord by:</p><ol><li>Swiping from right to left, which will open up a side menu</li><li>Then click on “Pins,” which is the second option from the left, as shown in the picture below</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-pinned-message-discord-mobile.jpg"                      alt="view Pinned message on Discord"                ></p><ol><li>Now you will be in the pinned messages window</li><li>You can jump to a specific pinned message by clicking on it, allowing you to access any content or links in the message</li></ol><h2 id="Part-5-Limit-on-Pinned-Messages"><a href="#Part-5-Limit-on-Pinned-Messages" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Limit on Pinned Messages"></a>Part 5: Limit on Pinned Messages</h2><p>You can only pin 50 messages in the pin box in Discord, meaning if you want to pin new messages, you will have to delete older ones to make space.</p><p>This may feel like a disadvantage. However, it makes perfect sense.
