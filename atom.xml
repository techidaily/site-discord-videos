It’s important to make sure you’ve got your best equipment setup to work for the highest quality audio and video possible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg"                      alt="Discord User Settings option"                ></p><p>So, start by heading to the User Settings page. You’ll find this at the bottom left of the screen – look for the cog icon next to your name. You won’t see this on mobile, this is only on the desktop app and the web browser version of Discord.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-settings.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video Call Settings "                ></p><p>Once you’ve opened settings, you’ll want to click on the <strong>Voice &amp; Video</strong> tab. Here you can check your microphone settings and adjust the volume, and choose your camera. If you’re using an external camera instead of the built-in option, check that the right one is selected in the dropdown.</p><p>You can also use this opportunity to run a test video – so that you know you’re well-lit, properly framed and otherwise good to go. You can adjust the lighting in your room or move the camera if you don’t feel it’s quite right.</p><p>One quick note for the web browser version of Discord – you’ll be asked to grant permission to your microphone and camera. Make sure you allow the site to use your equipment otherwise it won’t work on the video call.</p><p>Once you are happy, just click the close button at the top right of the settings options.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Private-Video-Call-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Private-Video-Call-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?"></a>Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?</h2><p>Once you’ve got your settings ready, you’re set to make your private Discord video call. If you’re doing it on the web browser or desktop app, you’ll need to first navigate to the inbox you share with the person you want to call. Do this by clicking on the Home button at the top left – you’ll then get a list of all your contacts.</p><p>If you’re only calling one person then it’s easy – just click on their name.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-discord-friend.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video Call with Friends "                ></p><p>If you want to call a private group, you need to click the + button and then create a group DM. Add the names of the users you want to call.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friend-group-video-call-discord.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video Call with group "                ></p><p>Once you’re in the direct message window of the person or group you want to call, you need to look at the buttons at the top right of the screen. The second icon that looks like a video camera is the one you’re looking for. Click that and you’ll start a video call.</p><p>You’ll see yourself on screen at this point, but you’ll need to wait until the other person or group members have joined the call for the chat to properly begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video Call interface"                ></p><p>The process of making video call on Discord mobile is essentially identical. You just need to open the direct message group and click on the video call icon, which is still at the top right of your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discrod-personal-video-call-mobile.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video Call interface on mobile"                ></p><p>You’ll need to give permissions for the Discord mobile app to use your microphone and camera if you haven’t already.</p><p>Once you’ve finished your video call on either desktop or mobile, just hit the red button to end it and switch your camera off again.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Server-Video-Call-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Server-Video-Call-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make a Server Video Call on Discord?"></a>Part 3: How to Make a Server Video Call on Discord?</h2><p>If you want to make a group video call on a public server, you again need to first navigate to the server. Once you’re there, you’ll need to join the voice channel that you should see on the left side of the screen.</p><p>Once you’re in the voice channel, click Lounge, Community Hangout or Stream Room, and then switch on your camera by clicking the ‘Video’ button. You’ll find this at the bottom-left of the screen. Again, if you’re on the web browser, you’ll be asked by your browser for permission to use your camera at this stage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-video-call.jpg"                      alt="Discord Server Video Call  "                ></p><p>And that’s it – the video call is now live and anyone who joins the voice channel will be able to see you, chat to you and switch on their camera to join the video conference as well.</p><p>On mobile, it’s slightly different. You’ll still want to head to the server you want to join and then click on the voice channel to join it. But as soon as you click on the voice channel, you’ll get a pop-up with an icon at the bottom right where you can instantly switch on your camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-video-call-mobile.jpg"                      alt="Discord Server Video Call on mobile  "                ></p><p>If you prefer, you can still just join as voice, and then at any stage click on your name where you’ll be able to then switch on your camera to turn a voice chat into a video call.</p><p>Whenever you want to end the video call, just click on your name again to switch off your camera, or disconnect completely from the voice channel.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Discord-Video-Chat-Call"><a href="#FAQs-About-Discord-Video-Chat-Call" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Discord Video Chat Call"></a>FAQs About Discord Video Chat Call</h2><h4 id="1-How-Many-People-Can-Join-in-the-Discord-Group-Video-Call"><a href="#1-How-Many-People-Can-Join-in-the-Discord-Group-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.</p><p>Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.</p><p>One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Best Screen Recorder Software for Discord Desktop App</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord"></a>Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.</p><h3 id="1-OBS"><a href="#1-OBS" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS"></a>1. OBS</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.</p><p>There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.</p><h3 id="2-Bandicam"><a href="#2-Bandicam" class="headerlink" title="2. Bandicam"></a>2. Bandicam</h3><p>Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.</p><p>Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn’t involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.</p><h3 id="3-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#3-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="3. Wondershare Filmora"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><h3 id="4-DemoCreator"><a href="#4-DemoCreator" class="headerlink" title="4. DemoCreator"></a>4. DemoCreator</h3><p>If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/" >Wondershare DemoCreator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.</p><p>You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.</p><h3 id="5-Camtasia"><a href="#5-Camtasia" class="headerlink" title="5. Camtasia"></a>5. Camtasia</h3><p>If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then <a class="link"   href="https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html" >Camtasia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.</p><p>However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorder-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord"></a>Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</h2><p>If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.</p><h3 id="2-Screen-Capture"><a href="#2-Screen-Capture" class="headerlink" title="2. Screen Capture"></a>2. Screen Capture</h3><p>One such option is <a class="link"   href="https://www.screencapture.com/" >Screen Capture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.</p><p>There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.</p><h3 id="3-Clipchamp"><a href="#3-Clipchamp" class="headerlink" title="3. Clipchamp"></a>3. Clipchamp</h3><p>If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer <a class="link"   href="https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/" >Clipchamp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.</p><p>It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.</p><h3 id="3-Screencast-o-matic"><a href="#3-Screencast-o-matic" class="headerlink" title="3. Screencast-o-matic"></a>3. Screencast-o-matic</h3><p>The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is <a class="link"   href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder" >Screencast-o-matic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.</p><p>Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.</p><p>The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Elevate-Your-Chats-Advanced-Message-Pinning-Techniques"><a href="#Elevate-Your-Chats-Advanced-Message-Pinning-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Elevate Your Chats: Advanced Message Pinning Techniques"></a>Elevate Your Chats: Advanced Message Pinning Techniques</h2><h1 id="How-to-Pin-A-Message-on-Discord"><a href="#How-to-Pin-A-Message-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="How to Pin A Message on Discord?"></a>How to Pin A Message on Discord?</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett"><a href="#Richard-Bennett" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Like TeamSpeak or Skype, Discord is a chat app aimed at easy mass communication.

In this example we’ll be using Among Us Manager Bot as an example.</p><p>After going to the Website, click the invite link button. Some websites might not have a button to “invite link”. In that case, look for a different button like “invite/add” etc.</p><p>After you click the button, you’ll have to sign in to your discord account and it will then ask which server you wish to add the bot to.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/connect-among-us-manager-to-discord.jpg"                      alt="Connect Among Us Manager  Bot to Discord "                ></p><p>Just select a server and then click continue.</p><p>Next, it’ll ask what permissions you want to give to the bot.

But you may lose some functions if a certain permission isn’t given.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/connect-among-us-manager-to-discord-permission-settings.jpg"                      alt="Connect Among Us Manager  Bot to Discord Permission Settings"                ></p><p>Click Authorize.

This isn’t huge at all – while there’s no definitive file size for video (as it depends on file type, resolution, compression, etc) it’s unlikely to be more than 60 seconds of footage, and could just be a few seconds.

There are a few ways around this, so take your pick from the one that sounds best for you.</p><h4 id="1-Update-to-Discord-Nitro-to-Upload-100MB"><a href="#1-Update-to-Discord-Nitro-to-Upload-100MB" class="headerlink" title="1. Update to Discord Nitro to Upload 100MB"></a>1. Update to Discord Nitro to Upload 100MB</h4><p>The first option is possibly the simplest but it’s definitely not the cheapest, and that’s to pay for an upgrade to Discord Nitro. The paid version of Discord has a number of benefits, one of which is the increased file upload size of 100MB. It costs $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, so if you’re likely to be regularly uploading videos that are lower than this limit, it might make sense.</p><h4 id="2-Cut-Unwanted-Clips-Compress-Video-with-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#2-Cut-Unwanted-Clips-Compress-Video-with-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="2. Cut Unwanted Clips/Compress Video with Filmora Video Editor"></a>2. Cut Unwanted Clips/Compress Video with Filmora Video Editor</h4><p>The second choice would be to take your video and cut it into pieces, sending them one at a time. This might sound time-consuming but with Filmora’s Instant Cutter Tool, it’s really simple.</p><p>All you need to do is open a video in Filmora by clicking the arrow next to Import and then choosing ‘Import with Instant Cutter Tool’.</p><p>This will open the Instant Cutter window where you can click Open File to add your video. From here you can trim your files and export them in multiple sections. There are different ways that you can do this, and while each is a simple process, there are still a few steps to follow.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>For more detail, check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >this post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a step-by-step guide on the different ways you can trim a video in Filmora.</p><p>You can also try to compress your video size, which may let you keep the whole video at the expense of some of the quality. Again, using Filmora, this is easy. But also again, there are different ways to go about it.</p><p>You could literally crop the video in order to trim some of the data, as the reduced viewing screen won’t be as big a file. You can also reduce the resolution, or convert your video to a format that uses fewer data. You’ll need to test it though, as converting to some video formats might result in blurry footage.</p><p>There are advanced settings you can tinker with too, such as lowering the frame rate or the bit rate. Again, rather than go through all of those options in an epic article here, it’s easier to head to a post dedicated to these steps about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >compress videos with Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="3-Upload-to-YouTube-Vimeo-Google-Drive-Dropbox"><a href="#3-Upload-to-YouTube-Vimeo-Google-Drive-Dropbox" class="headerlink" title="3. Upload to YouTube/Vimeo/Google Drive/Dropbox"></a>3. Upload to YouTube/Vimeo/Google Drive/Dropbox</h4><p>The final option is to upload your video to an online player or storage site, and link to it, rather than having Discord host the file. YouTube and Vimeo are the obvious options, but Streamable is another popular choice too with a free membership. YouTube’s maximum video uploads are 128GB, which is huge, while other sites like Streamable cap free accounts to 500MB per video.</p><p>So, if you want to upload massive files, you’ll need to decide whether to choose YouTube or pay for an upgraded membership elsewhere. Wherever you host your video, once it’s online just grab the link and paste it into Discord to share your content.</p><p>The only drawback to this option is that it stops other users from being able to download the video directly, and you may need to look at a file sharing alternative such as Dropbox if you want to send the actual file.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Uploading-Videos-to-Discord"><a href="#FAQs-About-Uploading-Videos-to-Discord" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord"></a>FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord</h2><h4 id="Which-Kind-of-Video-Formats-Can-I-Upload-to-Discord"><a href="#Which-Kind-of-Video-Formats-Can-I-Upload-to-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Which Kind of Video Formats Can I Upload to Discord?"></a>Which Kind of Video Formats Can I Upload to Discord?</h4><p>You can send any filetype to another user on Discord, so that they can download it and watch it on their own device.

There are different ways that you can do this, and while each is a simple process, there are still a few steps to follow.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>For more detail, check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >this post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a step-by-step guide on the different ways you can trim a video in Filmora.</p><p>You can also try to compress your video size, which may let you keep the whole video at the expense of some of the quality. Again, using Filmora, this is easy. But also again, there are different ways to go about it.</p><p>You could literally crop the video in order to trim some of the data, as the reduced viewing screen won’t be as big a file. You can also reduce the resolution, or convert your video to a format that uses fewer data. You’ll need to test it though, as converting to some video formats might result in blurry footage.</p><p>There are advanced settings you can tinker with too, such as lowering the frame rate or the bit rate. Again, rather than go through all of those options in an epic article here, it’s easier to head to a post dedicated to these steps about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >compress videos with Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="3-Upload-to-YouTube-Vimeo-Google-Drive-Dropbox-3"><a href="#3-Upload-to-YouTube-Vimeo-Google-Drive-Dropbox-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Upload to YouTube/Vimeo/Google Drive/Dropbox"></a>3. Upload to YouTube/Vimeo/Google Drive/Dropbox</h4><p>The final option is to upload your video to an online player or storage site, and link to it, rather than having Discord host the file. YouTube and Vimeo are the obvious options, but Streamable is another popular choice too with a free membership. YouTube’s maximum video uploads are 128GB, which is huge, while other sites like Streamable cap free accounts to 500MB per video.</p><p>So, if you want to upload massive files, you’ll need to decide whether to choose YouTube or pay for an upgraded membership elsewhere. Wherever you host your video, once it’s online just grab the link and paste it into Discord to share your content.</p><p>The only drawback to this option is that it stops other users from being able to download the video directly, and you may need to look at a file sharing alternative such as Dropbox if you want to send the actual file.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Uploading-Videos-to-Discord-3"><a href="#FAQs-About-Uploading-Videos-to-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord"></a>FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord</h2><h4 id="Which-Kind-of-Video-Formats-Can-I-Upload-to-Discord-3"><a href="#Which-Kind-of-Video-Formats-Can-I-Upload-to-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="Which Kind of Video Formats Can I Upload to Discord?"></a>Which Kind of Video Formats Can I Upload to Discord?</h4><p>You can send any filetype to another user on Discord, so that they can download it and watch it on their own device.

Since Discord serves to enable groups of friends or people with shared interests to communicate in real-time, standing out from the crowd and establishing a well-known and well-liked persona can be very challenging. Every element of presence on the platform contributes to the overall impression the user will make, and his profile picture is definitely one of the most impactful elements that go a long way towards identity building.</p><p><em><strong>It’s important to note that Discord users can only use a single profile picture or avatar on the platform, and can’t switch them from one server to another.</strong></em> This rule serves to establish some accountability and familiarity and applies even to server administrators. With that in mind, choosing a great image to represent you everywhere on the Discord platform is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly. To help you do this the right way while respecting all the rules, we prepared a detailed guide for this process.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#part1">Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part2">Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Create A Discord Avatar in Filmora?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part5">Part 5: Frequently Asked Questions About Discord PFP</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance"><a href="#Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance"></a>Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</h2><p>Like all other social networks and online communication services, Discord has a set of rules determining whether a certain image is suitable for use as an avatar.</p><p>First of all, you have to adhere to a size limit for technical reasons, as too large images would slow down the channel. On the other hand, too small images won’t be legible and can look bad due to pixelization. The most optimal image size you should use for your Discord profile photo is at least <strong>512 x 512 pixels</strong> – enough to be clearly visible and far above the <strong>180 x 180-pixel minimum</strong>.</p><p>You don’t have to use your real photo or likeness for your Discord avatar – in fact, you don’t have to use a realistic image at all. Discord allows the use of photographs as well as various types of illustrations and cartoon images and accepts JPG as well as the animated GIF format.</p><p>This gives you a lot of freedom to craft your new identity and uses some powerful imagery, either created from scratch or taken from the internet. However, there are still some community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your submission for a profile picture might be rejected for failing to meet Discord’s T&amp;C.</p><p>Basically, no NSFW images are allowed on Discord so you will have to avoid anything extreme or controversial. Pornographic content or explicit nudity is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions or promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality. You also need to stay away from violent imagery or anything depicting illegal activity, including drug use, racial discrimination, or mistreatment of animals. While this eliminates a lot of content, it still leaves enough room to express yourself freely without risking offending any other Discord users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-Download"><a href="#Part-2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-Download" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download"></a>Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download</h2><p>If you want to download a cool Discord profile picture, you can check the following websites:</p><h4 id="1-discordavatars-com"><a href="#1-discordavatars-com" class="headerlink" title="1. discordavatars.com"></a>1. discordavatars.com</h4><p>This website collects free Discord avatars and profile pictures, which allow you to download without any limitations.

It doesn’t take too much effort to make a fantastic avatar that will be completely unique and tell exactly the story you want. There are many different software tools you can use for this purpose, but since the task is very simple you can use a practical, free program such as Filmora.</p><p>The procedure of creating a profile picture for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complex and involves just a few simple steps.</p><p>You should start by identifying the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be an animated character or a real-life photo. You can search on Google image or download it from some discord profile sites.</p><p>Next, you need to load the selected image into a new project, and then resize the image to fit the preferred dimensions for Discord and change its shape to circular. To change the shape, go to Effects -&gt; Utility -&gt; Image Mask to optimize the image for a Discord avatar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-overlay-image-mask-discord-profile-wondershare-filmora.jpg"                      alt="create discord avatar with Filmora"                ></p><p>By adding overlays on top of the basic image, you can also introduce any visual or textual elements that will personalize the avatar even further. To get maximum attention, you might want to use a video or animation as part of the avatar – just add them to overlays and save your file as GIF. Since Discord allows GIF format, you can get an avatar that literally jumps off the page in every chat that you are a part of and elicits a strong reaction from those who see it.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Change-My-Profile-Picture-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Change-My-Profile-Picture-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?</h2><p>After you successfully created a profile image that you are completely satisfied with, it’s time to upload it to Discord and start using it as your avatar in all your chats.

Since Discord serves to enable groups of friends or people with shared interests to communicate in real-time, standing out from the crowd and establishing a well-known and well-liked persona can be very challenging. Every element of presence on the platform contributes to the overall impression the user will make, and his profile picture is definitely one of the most impactful elements that go a long way towards identity building.</p><p><em><strong>It’s important to note that Discord users can only use a single profile picture or avatar on the platform, and can’t switch them from one server to another.</strong></em> This rule serves to establish some accountability and familiarity and applies even to server administrators. With that in mind, choosing a great image to represent you everywhere on the Discord platform is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly. To help you do this the right way while respecting all the rules, we prepared a detailed guide for this process.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#part1">Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part2">Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Create A Discord Avatar in Filmora?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part5">Part 5: Frequently Asked Questions About Discord PFP</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance-3"><a href="#Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance"></a>Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</h2><p>Like all other social networks and online communication services, Discord has a set of rules determining whether a certain image is suitable for use as an avatar.</p><p>First of all, you have to adhere to a size limit for technical reasons, as too large images would slow down the channel. On the other hand, too small images won’t be legible and can look bad due to pixelization. The most optimal image size you should use for your Discord profile photo is at least <strong>512 x 512 pixels</strong> – enough to be clearly visible and far above the <strong>180 x 180-pixel minimum</strong>.</p><p>You don’t have to use your real photo or likeness for your Discord avatar – in fact, you don’t have to use a realistic image at all. Discord allows the use of photographs as well as various types of illustrations and cartoon images and accepts JPG as well as the animated GIF format.</p><p>This gives you a lot of freedom to craft your new identity and uses some powerful imagery, either created from scratch or taken from the internet. However, there are still some community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your submission for a profile picture might be rejected for failing to meet Discord’s T&amp;C.</p><p>Basically, no NSFW images are allowed on Discord so you will have to avoid anything extreme or controversial. Pornographic content or explicit nudity is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions or promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality. You also need to stay away from violent imagery or anything depicting illegal activity, including drug use, racial discrimination, or mistreatment of animals. While this eliminates a lot of content, it still leaves enough room to express yourself freely without risking offending any other Discord users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-Download-3"><a href="#Part-2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-Download-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download"></a>Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download</h2><p>If you want to download a cool Discord profile picture, you can check the following websites:</p><h4 id="1-discordavatars-com-3"><a href="#1-discordavatars-com-3" class="headerlink" title="1. discordavatars.com"></a>1. discordavatars.com</h4><p>This website collects free Discord avatars and profile pictures, which allow you to download without any limitations.

Since Discord serves to enable groups of friends or people with shared interests to communicate in real-time, standing out from the crowd and establishing a well-known and well-liked persona can be very challenging. Every element of presence on the platform contributes to the overall impression the user will make, and his profile picture is definitely one of the most impactful elements that go a long way towards identity building.</p><p><em><strong>It’s important to note that Discord users can only use a single profile picture or avatar on the platform, and can’t switch them from one server to another.</strong></em> This rule serves to establish some accountability and familiarity and applies even to server administrators. With that in mind, choosing a great image to represent you everywhere on the Discord platform is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly. To help you do this the right way while respecting all the rules, we prepared a detailed guide for this process.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#part1">Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part2">Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Create A Discord Avatar in Filmora?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part5">Part 5: Frequently Asked Questions About Discord PFP</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance"><a href="#Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance"></a>Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</h2><p>Like all other social networks and online communication services, Discord has a set of rules determining whether a certain image is suitable for use as an avatar.</p><p>First of all, you have to adhere to a size limit for technical reasons, as too large images would slow down the channel. On the other hand, too small images won’t be legible and can look bad due to pixelization. The most optimal image size you should use for your Discord profile photo is at least <strong>512 x 512 pixels</strong> – enough to be clearly visible and far above the <strong>180 x 180-pixel minimum</strong>.</p><p>You don’t have to use your real photo or likeness for your Discord avatar – in fact, you don’t have to use a realistic image at all. Discord allows the use of photographs as well as various types of illustrations and cartoon images and accepts JPG as well as the animated GIF format.</p><p>This gives you a lot of freedom to craft your new identity and uses some powerful imagery, either created from scratch or taken from the internet. However, there are still some community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your submission for a profile picture might be rejected for failing to meet Discord’s T&amp;C.</p><p>Basically, no NSFW images are allowed on Discord so you will have to avoid anything extreme or controversial. Pornographic content or explicit nudity is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions or promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality. You also need to stay away from violent imagery or anything depicting illegal activity, including drug use, racial discrimination, or mistreatment of animals. While this eliminates a lot of content, it still leaves enough room to express yourself freely without risking offending any other Discord users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-Download"><a href="#Part-2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-Download" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download"></a>Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download</h2><p>If you want to download a cool Discord profile picture, you can check the following websites:</p><h4 id="1-discordavatars-com"><a href="#1-discordavatars-com" class="headerlink" title="1. discordavatars.com"></a>1. discordavatars.com</h4><p>This website collects free Discord avatars and profile pictures, which allow you to download without any limitations.

It doesn’t take too much effort to make a fantastic avatar that will be completely unique and tell exactly the story you want. There are many different software tools you can use for this purpose, but since the task is very simple you can use a practical, free program such as Filmora.</p><p>The procedure of creating a profile picture for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complex and involves just a few simple steps.</p><p>You should start by identifying the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be an animated character or a real-life photo. You can search on Google image or download it from some discord profile sites.</p><p>Next, you need to load the selected image into a new project, and then resize the image to fit the preferred dimensions for Discord and change its shape to circular. To change the shape, go to Effects -&gt; Utility -&gt; Image Mask to optimize the image for a Discord avatar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-overlay-image-mask-discord-profile-wondershare-filmora.jpg"                      alt="create discord avatar with Filmora"                ></p><p>By adding overlays on top of the basic image, you can also introduce any visual or textual elements that will personalize the avatar even further. To get maximum attention, you might want to use a video or animation as part of the avatar – just add them to overlays and save your file as GIF. Since Discord allows GIF format, you can get an avatar that literally jumps off the page in every chat that you are a part of and elicits a strong reaction from those who see it.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Change-My-Profile-Picture-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Change-My-Profile-Picture-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?</h2><p>After you successfully created a profile image that you are completely satisfied with, it’s time to upload it to Discord and start using it as your avatar in all your chats. However, this is not done in the same way on different platforms, so you will need to follow the instructions for the type of system you normally use to access your Discord account.</p><h3 id="How-to-Change-Avatars-on-Discord-Desktop-Computer"><a href="#How-to-Change-Avatars-on-Discord-Desktop-Computer" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Avatars on Discord Desktop Computer?"></a>How to Change Avatars on Discord Desktop Computer?</h3><p>Open your Discord app (Mac or Windows version) and look for a gear icon in the bottom left corner of your screen. Clicking on this icon will take you to the User settings menu, where you need to find the My Account tab.</p><p>Next, hover with your mouse cursor over the current profile picture, then click on the icon that appears right next to it. This action will let you upload an image (JPG or GIF) from your hard drive and make it your new profile picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-discord-profile-avatar.jpg"                      alt="change discord avatar"                ></p><p>Keep in mind that Discord will automatically crop images that are not already in a circular format, so you need to make sure that the image is well centered before uploading.</p><h3 id="How-to-Change-Discord-Avatars-on-Mobile-Devices"><a href="#How-to-Change-Discord-Avatars-on-Mobile-Devices" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Discord Avatars on Mobile Devices?"></a>How to Change Discord Avatars on Mobile Devices?</h3><p>The procedure for changing the profile avatar on Discord from a mobile device is equally straightforward, and it’s similar on both Android and iOS phones. After you open the app, you need to tap on the icon in the right bottom corner to access the Account menu.</p><p>Find the profile picture in the screen that opens, and tap on it to access your phone gallery, then choose the image you would like to use for identification on Discord. It will automatically be uploaded and replace the current image as your only avatar on all Discord channels until it’s changed again.</p><h2 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Profile-Pictures-on-Discord"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Profile-Pictures-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Frequently Asked Questions About Profile Pictures on Discord"></a>Frequently Asked Questions About Profile Pictures on Discord</h2><h4 id="1-Why-can’t-I-change-my-profile-picture-on-Discord"><a href="#1-Why-can’t-I-change-my-profile-picture-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="1. Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?"></a>1. Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?</h4><p>If you experience this problem, it’s most likely a consequence of trying to make too many picture changes too fast. While Discord will allow you to upload two profile images in rapid succession, the third attempt within a few minutes is going to be unsuccessful. The problem will disappear if you wait for a short period of time and try uploading again. Another reason might be that your firewall is preventing you from using an image from a cloud server, but you can easily bypass the issue and download the picture first to your hard disc before uploading it to Discord from there.</p><h4 id="2-How-can-I-find-my-old-profile-picture"><a href="#2-How-can-I-find-my-old-profile-picture" class="headerlink" title="2.

How can I find my old profile picture?</h4><p>All of the images you previously used as Discord avatars remain memorized and can be reactivated at any time. You can find this collection of images on a specific portion of your profile page, so if you want to use any of them you can simply click on them without having to go through the regular upload process all over again.</p><h4 id="3-What-do-the-colored-dots-next-to-my-profile-picture-mean"><a href="#3-What-do-the-colored-dots-next-to-my-profile-picture-mean" class="headerlink" title="3. What do the colored dots next to my profile picture mean?"></a>3. What do the colored dots next to my profile picture mean?</h4><p>Those dots indicate the current status of the user, with each color having a fixed meaning. If you see a green dot, the user is available to chat at the moment. A yellow dot indicated an idle user that hasn’t been active in a while, and the red color means the user is busy and doesn’t want to be disturbed.

Since Discord serves to enable groups of friends or people with shared interests to communicate in real-time, standing out from the crowd and establishing a well-known and well-liked persona can be very challenging. Every element of presence on the platform contributes to the overall impression the user will make, and his profile picture is definitely one of the most impactful elements that go a long way towards identity building.</p><p><em><strong>It’s important to note that Discord users can only use a single profile picture or avatar on the platform, and can’t switch them from one server to another.</strong></em> This rule serves to establish some accountability and familiarity and applies even to server administrators. With that in mind, choosing a great image to represent you everywhere on the Discord platform is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly. To help you do this the right way while respecting all the rules, we prepared a detailed guide for this process.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#part1">Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part2">Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Create A Discord Avatar in Filmora?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part5">Part 5: Frequently Asked Questions About Discord PFP</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance-3"><a href="#Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance"></a>Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</h2><p>Like all other social networks and online communication services, Discord has a set of rules determining whether a certain image is suitable for use as an avatar.</p><p>First of all, you have to adhere to a size limit for technical reasons, as too large images would slow down the channel. On the other hand, too small images won’t be legible and can look bad due to pixelization. The most optimal image size you should use for your Discord profile photo is at least <strong>512 x 512 pixels</strong> – enough to be clearly visible and far above the <strong>180 x 180-pixel minimum</strong>.</p><p>You don’t have to use your real photo or likeness for your Discord avatar – in fact, you don’t have to use a realistic image at all. Discord allows the use of photographs as well as various types of illustrations and cartoon images and accepts JPG as well as the animated GIF format.</p><p>This gives you a lot of freedom to craft your new identity and uses some powerful imagery, either created from scratch or taken from the internet. However, there are still some community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your submission for a profile picture might be rejected for failing to meet Discord’s T&amp;C.</p><p>Basically, no NSFW images are allowed on Discord so you will have to avoid anything extreme or controversial. Pornographic content or explicit nudity is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions or promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality. You also need to stay away from violent imagery or anything depicting illegal activity, including drug use, racial discrimination, or mistreatment of animals. While this eliminates a lot of content, it still leaves enough room to express yourself freely without risking offending any other Discord users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-Download-3"><a href="#Part-2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-Download-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download"></a>Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download</h2><p>If you want to download a cool Discord profile picture, you can check the following websites:</p><h4 id="1-discordavatars-com-3"><a href="#1-discordavatars-com-3" class="headerlink" title="1. discordavatars.com"></a>1. discordavatars.com</h4><p>This website collects free Discord avatars and profile pictures, which allow you to download without any limitations.

It doesn’t take too much effort to make a fantastic avatar that will be completely unique and tell exactly the story you want. There are many different software tools you can use for this purpose, but since the task is very simple you can use a practical, free program such as Filmora.</p><p>The procedure of creating a profile picture for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complex and involves just a few simple steps.</p><p>You should start by identifying the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be an animated character or a real-life photo. You can search on Google image or download it from some discord profile sites.</p><p>Next, you need to load the selected image into a new project, and then resize the image to fit the preferred dimensions for Discord and change its shape to circular. To change the shape, go to Effects -&gt; Utility -&gt; Image Mask to optimize the image for a Discord avatar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-overlay-image-mask-discord-profile-wondershare-filmora.jpg"                      alt="create discord avatar with Filmora"                ></p><p>By adding overlays on top of the basic image, you can also introduce any visual or textual elements that will personalize the avatar even further. To get maximum attention, you might want to use a video or animation as part of the avatar – just add them to overlays and save your file as GIF. Since Discord allows GIF format, you can get an avatar that literally jumps off the page in every chat that you are a part of and elicits a strong reaction from those who see it.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Change-My-Profile-Picture-on-Discord-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Change-My-Profile-Picture-on-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?</h2><p>After you successfully created a profile image that you are completely satisfied with, it’s time to upload it to Discord and start using it as your avatar in all your chats.

Emojis are not animated, and you can send basic Smiley or Sad faces (of course, there are animals and flowers, too). On the other hand, stickers are animated, and there can be specific sticker characters like What’s Up Wumpus.</p><ol><li><strong>Why can’t I see the Sticker option on my Discord app?</strong></li></ol><p>You cannot access the stickers on Discord probably because the feature has not been launched in your country yet. Stickers are only available for users in Brazil, Japan, and Canada. They will be launched in other countries after testing and feedback.</p><ol><li><strong>Is Discord sticker free?</strong></li></ol><p>If you are a Nitro subscriber, you will get the What’s Up Wumpus sticker pack for free. You will have to buy the other packs. As a $9.99 Nitro subscriber, you can get other packs at a 33% discount.</p><ol><li><strong>Can I keep the purchased sticker pack forever in my account?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, once you buy a pack, you will have lifetime access to it. However, if you delete your Discord account, you will not get your stickers back. Further, packs like ‘Wumpus Nitro Elite’ can be accessed only on an active $9.99 subscription.</p><ol><li><strong>Can people who are outside of Brazil, Canada, and Japan receive the stickers I sent?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, users from countries other than Japan, Canada, and Brazil can see the stickers in the chat sent to them. However, they could not buy or send them.</p><ol><li><strong>Why my Discord sticker is not moving&#x2F;animating?</strong></li></ol><p>The stickers should move by default when sent. You can check if your sticker inventory is set to the smallest size. You can also go to User Settings, tap on Text &amp; Images, and select Stickers. Adjust the settings appropriately. You can contact the Discord support team should you need further assistance.</p><p>Be patient until the cool update rolls out worldwide!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-5"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-5" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>From Facebook to even WhatsApp and Telegram, plain texts have become boring.

View all the stickers to see what the pack looks like.</li><li>Tap on the purchase button that is located right beside the name of the pack.</li><li>You will be prompted to input your payment details. If you have saved a payment option on Discord, you can choose the relevant option.</li><li>Agree to the Terms and Services of Discord.</li><li>Finally, hit the purchase tab.</li><li>The sticker pack is added to the inventory instantly.</li><li>You can start sending them in the texts.</li></ul><p>Note that Discord does not refund the money that is once paid. So, you cannot return the stickers to get a refund.</p><p>Another interesting thing to note is that the Sticker Shop refreshes and offers new sticker packs. Due to this rotation, a pack that is available in the shop today may be replaced by a new one tomorrow.</p><p>But don’t worry. A timer displayed at the top left corner (besides the title) lets you know for how long the pack is available in the shop. You can grab it before the time runs out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remaining-days-fordiscord-sticker.jpg"                      alt="Discord Stickers remaining days"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Use-Stickers-on-Discord-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Use-Stickers-on-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Use Stickers on Discord?"></a>Part 5: How to Use Stickers on Discord?</h2><p>Buying stickers is useless if you don’t send them over texts.

Emojis are not animated, and you can send basic Smiley or Sad faces (of course, there are animals and flowers, too). On the other hand, stickers are animated, and there can be specific sticker characters like What’s Up Wumpus.</p><ol><li><strong>Why can’t I see the Sticker option on my Discord app?</strong></li></ol><p>You cannot access the stickers on Discord probably because the feature has not been launched in your country yet. Stickers are only available for users in Brazil, Japan, and Canada. They will be launched in other countries after testing and feedback.</p><ol><li><strong>Is Discord sticker free?</strong></li></ol><p>If you are a Nitro subscriber, you will get the What’s Up Wumpus sticker pack for free. You will have to buy the other packs. As a $9.99 Nitro subscriber, you can get other packs at a 33% discount.</p><ol><li><strong>Can I keep the purchased sticker pack forever in my account?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, once you buy a pack, you will have lifetime access to it. However, if you delete your Discord account, you will not get your stickers back. Further, packs like ‘Wumpus Nitro Elite’ can be accessed only on an active $9.99 subscription.</p><ol><li><strong>Can people who are outside of Brazil, Canada, and Japan receive the stickers I sent?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, users from countries other than Japan, Canada, and Brazil can see the stickers in the chat sent to them. However, they could not buy or send them.</p><ol><li><strong>Why my Discord sticker is not moving&#x2F;animating?</strong></li></ol><p>The stickers should move by default when sent. You can check if your sticker inventory is set to the smallest size. You can also go to User Settings, tap on Text &amp; Images, and select Stickers. Adjust the settings appropriately. You can contact the Discord support team should you need further assistance.</p><p>Be patient until the cool update rolls out worldwide!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-maximizing-discord-connectivity-through-media-transfer-for-2024/"><u>[New] Maximizing Discord Connectivity Through Media Transfer for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/the-prime-list-of-budget-friendly-discord-voice-recording-tools/"><u>The Prime List of Budget-Friendly Discord Voice Recording Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-elite-online-screenshots-and-recorders-discord-focus-for-2024/"><u>[New] Elite Online Screenshots & Recorders - Discord Focus for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/elevate-your-audio-game-the-finest-auditory-experience-discord-has-to-offer-for-2024/"><u>Elevate Your Audio Game  The Finest Auditory Experience Discord Has to Offer for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/top-auditory-aids-the-ultimate-list-of-premium-discord-music-bots-to-try/"><u>Top Auditory Aids  The Ultimate List of Premium Discord Music Bots to Try</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-sticker-savvy-on-discord-platform/"><u>In 2024, Sticker Savvy on Discord Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-cut-through-background-noise-in-discord-conversations-using-voicemod/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Cut Through Background Noise in Discord Conversations Using VoiceMod</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-screen-sharing-on-discord/"><u>2024 Approved  Mastering Screen Sharing on Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-make-your-discord-messages-hearable-learn-tts/"><u>In 2024, Make Your Discord Messages Hearable  Learn TTS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-top-5-dynamic-visual-identity-examples-in-social-space/"><u>[Updated] Top 5 Dynamic Visual Identity Examples in Social Space</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/streamlining-the-process-of-sending-videos-in-discord/"><u>Streamlining the Process of Sending Videos in Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-quick-start-applying-discord-spoilers-correctly/"><u>[New] In 2024, Quick Start  Applying Discord Spoilers Correctly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-adjusting-discord-presence/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Step-by-Step Guide  Adjusting Discord Presence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/perfect-your-discord-voices-avoiding-background-noise-with-voicemod/"><u>Perfect Your Discord Voices  Avoiding Background Noise with VoiceMod</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-pro-level-discord-capture-software-analysis/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Pro-Level Discord Capture Software Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-finding-the-perfect-voip-service-discord-vs-skype-dilemma-for-2024/"><u>[New] Finding the Perfect VoIP Service  Discord Vs Skype Dilemma for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-remove-a-desktop-discord-server-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Remove a Desktop Discord Server for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ideal-chat-app-for-you-discord-versus-skype-comparison/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ideal Chat App for You?

OBS</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.</p><p>There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.</p><h3 id="2-Bandicam"><a href="#2-Bandicam" class="headerlink" title="2. Bandicam"></a>2. Bandicam</h3><p>Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.</p><p>Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn’t involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license.

Screen Capture</h3><p>One such option is <a class="link"   href="https://www.screencapture.com/" >Screen Capture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.</p><p>There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.</p><h3 id="3-Clipchamp"><a href="#3-Clipchamp" class="headerlink" title="3. Clipchamp"></a>3.

Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.</p><p>It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.</p><h3 id="3-Screencast-o-matic"><a href="#3-Screencast-o-matic" class="headerlink" title="3.

This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.</p><p>The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android"><a href="#Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android"></a>Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen.

OBS</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.</p><p>There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays.

So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.</p><h3 id="2-Bandicam-1"><a href="#2-Bandicam-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Bandicam"></a>2. Bandicam</h3><p>Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.</p><p>Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn’t involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license.

Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.</p><p>You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.</p><h3 id="5-Camtasia-1"><a href="#5-Camtasia-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Camtasia"></a>5.

Screen Capture</h3><p>One such option is <a class="link"   href="https://www.screencapture.com/" >Screen Capture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.</p><p>There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.</p><h3 id="3-Clipchamp-1"><a href="#3-Clipchamp-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Clipchamp"></a>3.

Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.</p><p>It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.</p><h3 id="3-Screencast-o-matic-1"><a href="#3-Screencast-o-matic-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android-1"><a href="#Part-3-Best-Screen-Recorder-Apps-for-Discord-on-iPhone-and-Android-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android"></a>Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen.

So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.</p><p>One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-7"><a href="#In-this-article-7" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Best Screen Recorder Software for Discord Desktop App</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord-3"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Windows-Mac-Screen-Recorder-Software-for-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord"></a>Part 1: Best Windows&#x2F;Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord</h2><p>If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

OBS</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.</p><p>There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.</p><h3 id="2-Bandicam-3"><a href="#2-Bandicam-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Bandicam"></a>2.

But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.</p><p>Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn’t involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license.

Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.</p><p>This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.</p><p>Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.</p><p>After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members’ area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?</h2><p>Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.</p><p>Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type <em>–help</em> for Groovy and similarly for every other bot ([specified prefix]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.</p><p>Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.</p><p>You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the <em>–loop track</em> command. And loop your whole queue using –<em>loop queue</em>. You can turn the loop off by –<em>loop off</em>.</p><p>If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the <em>–queue</em> command.</p><p>In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?"></a>Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?</h2><p>Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmore Discord video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size.

Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.</p><p><strong>Discord music bots</strong> provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time.

Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.</p><p>This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.</p><p>Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.</p><p>After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members’ area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?</h2><p>Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.</p><p>Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type <em>–help</em> for Groovy and similarly for every other bot ([specified prefix]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.</p><p>Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.</p><p>You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the <em>–loop track</em> command. And loop your whole queue using –<em>loop queue</em>. You can turn the loop off by –<em>loop off</em>.</p><p>If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the <em>–queue</em> command.</p><p>In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes-1"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes-1" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?"></a>Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?</h2><p>Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmore Discord video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size.

Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends.

Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.</p><p>This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.</p><p>Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.</p><p>After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members’ area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-2"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?</h2><p>Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.</p><p>Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type <em>–help</em> for Groovy and similarly for every other bot ([specified prefix]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.</p><p>Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.</p><p>You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the <em>–loop track</em> command. And loop your whole queue using –<em>loop queue</em>. You can turn the loop off by –<em>loop off</em>.</p><p>If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the <em>–queue</em> command.</p><p>In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes-2"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes-2" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?"></a>Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?</h2><p>Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmore Discord video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size.

Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.</p><p><strong>Discord music bots</strong> provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time.

ErisBot"></a>10. <a class="link"   href="https://erisbot.com/" >ErisBot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>ErisBot is a strong and very simple-to-use music bot.</p><p>The best feature about ErisBot that separates it from the rest is that it allows you to create your very own custom prefixes for the commands.</p><p>One thing I noticed is that sometimes instead of playing audio from the YouTube link, it starts playing the video. Maybe it mixes up the commands or whatever. This is something you’ll have to keep in mind while using Eris Bot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators-3"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators-3" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.</p><p>This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.</p><p>Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.</p><p>After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members’ area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?</h2><p>Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.</p><p>Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type <em>–help</em> for Groovy and similarly for every other bot ([specified prefix]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.</p><p>Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.</p><p>You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the <em>–loop track</em> command. And loop your whole queue using –<em>loop queue</em>. You can turn the loop off by –<em>loop off</em>.</p><p>If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the <em>–queue</em> command.</p><p>In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes-3"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes-3" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?"></a>Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?</h2><p>Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmore Discord video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size.

Here are the steps to follow to add an animated emoji:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, go to a website called <a class="link"   href="https://betterdiscord.app/" >https://betterdiscord.app/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Once you are there, click on the Download option.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will see a page loaded with codes, right-click on the screen and click on the Save option. When it is downloaded, click on the Better Discord Windows installer. Next, read the license agreement and click on the Next option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Then click install better Discord and hit the next button. Choose the Discord version that you currently have installed.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Open Discord and click on the user settings. There, you will see the Better Discord section. Next, click on the Plugin option. Now, close the Discord window and drag the animated status dot plugin into the plugin folder that opened after clicking on the Plugin option.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Go to Discord again, and you will see the Animated Status option. Enable it and click on the gear icon. To add an animated emoji, click on the + icon. Next, you will see a Nitro ID field. Then, go to a chat page and click on the emoji option.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Look at the emoji that you like and memorize the animated emoji name. Press \ followed by the name of the emoji. Now, copy the whole text and paste it again. You will see a few numbers; that’s the Nitro ID for the emoji. Copy the number only, go back to the Animated plugin and paste it on the Nitro ID field. Go back to the Nitro page again, and you will see the animated emoji on your status.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Custom-Discord-Status-Emoji-Ideas-3"><a href="#Part-5-Custom-Discord-Status-Emoji-Ideas-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Custom Discord Status Emoji Ideas"></a>Part 5: Custom Discord Status Emoji Ideas</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/custom-discord-status-emoji-ideas.jpg"                      alt="custom discord status emoji ideas"                ></p><p>If you want to make your Discord Status look really cool, you can get some custom Discord status emoji ideas from us.

A unique feature of this platform is that it facilitates community-based communication, where users who share certain interests can form their own private chats that are known as servers.</p><p>While its user interface is quite simple, Discord allows users to deploy a variety of advanced communication tools, from textual content to audio and video streams. It’s natural that users want to express their thoughts creatively, so there is a lot of genuine interest in learning how to change the visual look of the messages through the use of basic text formatting. In this article, we will discuss how to change text style in Discord and provide detailed instructions for activating various options, such as using bold or italic letters or underlining a part of the text.</p><p>Let’s start with the software module that makes it all possible.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#part1">Part 1: How Does Discord Text Engine Work?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Change Text Style in Discord with Markdown?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Use Code Block for Discord Text Formatting?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part5">Part 5: FAQs About Discord Text Formatting</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-How-Does-Discord-Text-Engine-Work"><a href="#Part-1-How-Does-Discord-Text-Engine-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How Does Discord Text Engine Work?"></a>Part 1: How Does Discord Text Engine Work?</h2><p>Beneath the surface, Discord runs on a powerful engine called Markdown, which regulates how text is displayed on the pages visible to users. It’s an application of markup language that completely depends on textual symbols as commands, making it quite simple for users who are not skilled at advanced programming to alter the look of the text.</p><p>Basically, Markdown allows you to enter a few symbols and it will interpret them as commands for changing the text style, for example bolding or underlying certain word or sentence. For highlighting blocks of text, there is a specific library named <a class="link"   href="https://highlightjs.org/" >Highlight.js <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that allows simple text marking for stylistic emphasis.</p><p>This approach is very practical and easy to learn, so long-time users of Discord are able to change text style as they type without thinking too much about it.

A unique feature of this platform is that it facilitates community-based communication, where users who share certain interests can form their own private chats that are known as servers.</p><p>While its user interface is quite simple, Discord allows users to deploy a variety of advanced communication tools, from textual content to audio and video streams. It’s natural that users want to express their thoughts creatively, so there is a lot of genuine interest in learning how to change the visual look of the messages through the use of basic text formatting.

It’s an application of markup language that completely depends on textual symbols as commands, making it quite simple for users who are not skilled at advanced programming to alter the look of the text.</p><p>Basically, Markdown allows you to enter a few symbols and it will interpret them as commands for changing the text style, for example bolding or underlying certain word or sentence. For highlighting blocks of text, there is a specific library named <a class="link"   href="https://highlightjs.org/" >Highlight.js <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that allows simple text marking for stylistic emphasis.</p><p>This approach is very practical and easy to learn, so long-time users of Discord are able to change text style as they type without thinking too much about it.

One way to do it is to deploy code blocks, which can be activated with the backtick character ( ` ) placed on the beginning and the end of a text section. This command will highlight the chosen part of the text while preserving blank space around it for extra emphasis of your message. However, if you use three consecutive ( ` ) signs before a block of text and separate the text into several lines by pressing enter, the result will be a series of highlighted lines that form a single code block. This option is simple enough that even beginners with no programming abilities can easily learn how to use it, and it has some practical applications that savvy Discord users are very fond of.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Change-the-Text-Color-in-Discord-Message-2"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Change-the-Text-Color-in-Discord-Message-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?"></a>Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?</h2><p>It’s not possible to alter the default text color from the native user interface in Discord. However, there is a simple solution to this problem that involves the highlight.is scrip mentioned earlier in the article. This Javascript-based library can transform the normal text into a code block consisting of three lines, where the middle line would be your selection of text in an alternative color. This is a neat workaround that’s very simple to activate using the same kind of text-based commands described above.</p><p>To change the text color, you should create a simple, three-line block. In the top line, you need to put three backtick characters (”’) along with a code phrase corresponding to the text color you would like to use. In the second line, you should type your entire text normally, while the bottom line should include three more backticks. You can create new lines by pressing the Shift and Enter keys at the same time.</p><p>Here is a detailed video tutorial for creating customized text in a range of different colors with all the relevant code phrases.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Discord-Text-Formatting-2"><a href="#FAQs-About-Discord-Text-Formatting-2" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Discord Text Formatting"></a>FAQs About Discord Text Formatting</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-the-default-Discord-font-2"><a href="#1-What-is-the-default-Discord-font-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

One way to do it is to deploy code blocks, which can be activated with the backtick character ( ` ) placed on the beginning and the end of a text section. This command will highlight the chosen part of the text while preserving blank space around it for extra emphasis of your message. However, if you use three consecutive ( ` ) signs before a block of text and separate the text into several lines by pressing enter, the result will be a series of highlighted lines that form a single code block. This option is simple enough that even beginners with no programming abilities can easily learn how to use it, and it has some practical applications that savvy Discord users are very fond of.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Change-the-Text-Color-in-Discord-Message-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Change-the-Text-Color-in-Discord-Message-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?"></a>Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?</h2><p>It’s not possible to alter the default text color from the native user interface in Discord. However, there is a simple solution to this problem that involves the highlight.is scrip mentioned earlier in the article. This Javascript-based library can transform the normal text into a code block consisting of three lines, where the middle line would be your selection of text in an alternative color. This is a neat workaround that’s very simple to activate using the same kind of text-based commands described above.</p><p>To change the text color, you should create a simple, three-line block. In the top line, you need to put three backtick characters (”’) along with a code phrase corresponding to the text color you would like to use. In the second line, you should type your entire text normally, while the bottom line should include three more backticks. You can create new lines by pressing the Shift and Enter keys at the same time.</p><p>Here is a detailed video tutorial for creating customized text in a range of different colors with all the relevant code phrases.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Discord-Text-Formatting-3"><a href="#FAQs-About-Discord-Text-Formatting-3" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Discord Text Formatting"></a>FAQs About Discord Text Formatting</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-the-default-Discord-font-3"><a href="#1-What-is-the-default-Discord-font-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

In this example, we are going to be using the Dyno bot:</p><ol><li>First, you need to visit Dyno’s <a class="link"   href="https://dyno.gg/bot" >website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and then click on “Join us on Discord”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-reply-bot-discord-dyno.jpg"                      alt="auto reply  message on Discord "                ></p><ol><li>Now you will have to sign in to your Discord account from your browser</li><li>Next, you will have to pick which server you want to invite the bot to</li><li>From the same screen, you can decide which permissions to assign to the bot. The ones that matter to us are read messages and send messages</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-dyno-permissions-discord.jpg"                      alt="set up permission for bots "                ></p><ol><li>The last step is to verify that you are not a robot yourself and check I’m not a robot.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/connect-to-discord-dyno.jpg"                      alt="connect bots to Discord"                ></p><p>After this, the Dyno bot will be added to your Discord server. To allow the bot to send messages, you need to visit Dyno’s website and turn on the autoresponder, enabling you to set up your auto-reply.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Reply-to-Messages-with-Reactions-on-Discord-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Reply-to-Messages-with-Reactions-on-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Reply to Messages with Reactions on Discord"></a>Part 4: How to Reply to Messages with Reactions on Discord</h2><p>Discord allows you to react to posts with emojis.

And unlike other apps, Discord does not allow users to mass-delete their message history. For some, that can sound like a nightmare because of privacy and security reasons. You will have to wade through every message, deleting each of them, one by one.</p><p>However, if you find yourself in that position, fret not because there are several solutions to help you get around this limitation. Unfortunately, none of them are perfect.</p><p>Since there is no official method of mass deleting messages, these workarounds are shoddy, but until Discord offers an official solution, we’ll have to do with them.</p><p>If you’re looking to mass-delete your messages from a server or channel on Discord, here’s how you will go about it for the desktop and mobile versions:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: How to Delete Direct Messages on Discord</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Deleting Channel Messages in Discord</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part 4: Deleting Messages with Discord Clear Chat Bot</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part5"><strong>Part 5: Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-Discord-Message-Types"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-Discord-Message-Types" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types"></a>Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types</h2><p>In Discord, you will see two types of messages: Direct Messages and Channel Messages in servers. Here are the differences between the two:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct Messages</strong>: These messages are private and held between two users</li><li><strong>Channel Messages</strong>: These messages are sent in a channel or a specific group</li></ul><p>Both of these message types abide by different rules and functions. In the early days of Discord, users had the luxury of deleting messages in bulk.</p><p>However, this was soon changed because the mass execution directly affected the app’s database. Since then, the application has adopted specific rules regarding message deletion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

That leads us to the possibility of utilizing the ‘AutoHotkey’ script to automate the process.</p><p>Most developers have come up with codes that can delete Discord messages from your account on a mass scale. We’ll be expanding on one of the most popular instances of this: the AutoHotkey script.</p><p>Before you get started with this, you will need an ‘AutoHotkey installer.’ Continue the process by:</p><ol><li>Download and install the ‘AutoHotkey installer’ ;</li><li>Head onto your desktop, right-click and click ‘New’ on the drop-down menu;</li><li>Choose the ‘AutoHotkey script’ and right-click on this file and edit with ‘Notepad’</li><li>Delete everything in the script and paste the following code</li></ol><p><strong><em>t::</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Loop, 100000</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>{</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Up}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, ^a</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {BS}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Enter}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Enter}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>sleep, 100</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Return</em></strong></p><ol><li>Save the file as any name that you wish to</li><li>Once you’ve done that, launch Discord and double-click on the script file</li><li>Open the chat data that you wish to delete and press T</li><li>The script will now delete all the messages</li></ol><p>To stop the script, click on the H icon located on the right side of your taskbar and select Pause Script.</p><p>This is the process by which you can use an ‘Autohotkey script’ to delete messages in bulk. Please note that this option is only available to Windows users as AutoHotkey does not currently work on macOS.</p><p>Ideally, you’ll want the following things from your AutoHotkey script:</p><ol><li>A toggle key for turning it on and off</li><li>The complete keyboard sequence with stops between each step</li></ol><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: you can delete a message you sent, but there’s no saying if the other person took a screenshot before you got around to deleting it. Things on the internet tend to stick around. So, as a safe bet, it’s a good idea to take some time to consider what you wrote before pressing send to avoid any regrets.</p><h4 id="You-May-Also-Interested-In"><a href="#You-May-Also-Interested-In" class="headerlink" title="You May Also Interested In"></a>You May Also Interested In</h4><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Discord Font Generators [Online&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;Android] <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Discord Emoji Makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10+ Best Free Discord Voice Changers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="FAQs-About-Deleting-Discord-Messages"><a href="#FAQs-About-Deleting-Discord-Messages" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Deleting Discord Messages"></a>FAQs About Deleting Discord Messages</h2><h4 id="1-Can-I-Recover-A-Deleted-Message-on-Discord"><a href="#1-Can-I-Recover-A-Deleted-Message-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="1.

And unlike other apps, Discord does not allow users to mass-delete their message history. For some, that can sound like a nightmare because of privacy and security reasons. You will have to wade through every message, deleting each of them, one by one.</p><p>However, if you find yourself in that position, fret not because there are several solutions to help you get around this limitation. Unfortunately, none of them are perfect.</p><p>Since there is no official method of mass deleting messages, these workarounds are shoddy, but until Discord offers an official solution, we’ll have to do with them.</p><p>If you’re looking to mass-delete your messages from a server or channel on Discord, here’s how you will go about it for the desktop and mobile versions:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: How to Delete Direct Messages on Discord</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Deleting Channel Messages in Discord</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part 4: Deleting Messages with Discord Clear Chat Bot</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part5"><strong>Part 5: Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-Discord-Message-Types-1"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-Discord-Message-Types-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types"></a>Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types</h2><p>In Discord, you will see two types of messages: Direct Messages and Channel Messages in servers. Here are the differences between the two:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct Messages</strong>: These messages are private and held between two users</li><li><strong>Channel Messages</strong>: These messages are sent in a channel or a specific group</li></ul><p>Both of these message types abide by different rules and functions. In the early days of Discord, users had the luxury of deleting messages in bulk.</p><p>However, this was soon changed because the mass execution directly affected the app’s database.

Unfortunately, none of them are perfect.</p><p>Since there is no official method of mass deleting messages, these workarounds are shoddy, but until Discord offers an official solution, we’ll have to do with them.</p><p>If you’re looking to mass-delete your messages from a server or channel on Discord, here’s how you will go about it for the desktop and mobile versions:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: How to Delete Direct Messages on Discord</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Deleting Channel Messages in Discord</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part 4: Deleting Messages with Discord Clear Chat Bot</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part5"><strong>Part 5: Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-Discord-Message-Types-3"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-Discord-Message-Types-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types"></a>Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types</h2><p>In Discord, you will see two types of messages: Direct Messages and Channel Messages in servers. Here are the differences between the two:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct Messages</strong>: These messages are private and held between two users</li><li><strong>Channel Messages</strong>: These messages are sent in a channel or a specific group</li></ul><p>Both of these message types abide by different rules and functions. In the early days of Discord, users had the luxury of deleting messages in bulk.</p><p>However, this was soon changed because the mass execution directly affected the app’s database.

Messages that are older than this timeframe can be queued and discarded one-by-one.</p><p>One particular bot that is of interest to us is the MEE6.

That leads us to the possibility of utilizing the ‘AutoHotkey’ script to automate the process.</p><p>Most developers have come up with codes that can delete Discord messages from your account on a mass scale. We’ll be expanding on one of the most popular instances of this: the AutoHotkey script.</p><p>Before you get started with this, you will need an ‘AutoHotkey installer.’ Continue the process by:</p><ol><li>Download and install the ‘AutoHotkey installer’ ;</li><li>Head onto your desktop, right-click and click ‘New’ on the drop-down menu;</li><li>Choose the ‘AutoHotkey script’ and right-click on this file and edit with ‘Notepad’</li><li>Delete everything in the script and paste the following code</li></ol><p><strong><em>t::</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Loop, 100000</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>{</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Up}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, ^a</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {BS}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Enter}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>send, {Enter}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>sleep, 100</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>}</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Return</em></strong></p><ol><li>Save the file as any name that you wish to</li><li>Once you’ve done that, launch Discord and double-click on the script file</li><li>Open the chat data that you wish to delete and press T</li><li>The script will now delete all the messages</li></ol><p>To stop the script, click on the H icon located on the right side of your taskbar and select Pause Script.</p><p>This is the process by which you can use an ‘Autohotkey script’ to delete messages in bulk. Please note that this option is only available to Windows users as AutoHotkey does not currently work on macOS.</p><p>Ideally, you’ll want the following things from your AutoHotkey script:</p><ol><li>A toggle key for turning it on and off</li><li>The complete keyboard sequence with stops between each step</li></ol><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: you can delete a message you sent, but there’s no saying if the other person took a screenshot before you got around to deleting it. Things on the internet tend to stick around. So, as a safe bet, it’s a good idea to take some time to consider what you wrote before pressing send to avoid any regrets.</p><h4 id="You-May-Also-Interested-In-3"><a href="#You-May-Also-Interested-In-3" class="headerlink" title="You May Also Interested In"></a>You May Also Interested In</h4><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Discord Font Generators [Online&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;Android] <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Discord Emoji Makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10+ Best Free Discord Voice Changers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="FAQs-About-Deleting-Discord-Messages-3"><a href="#FAQs-About-Deleting-Discord-Messages-3" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Deleting Discord Messages"></a>FAQs About Deleting Discord Messages</h2><h4 id="1-Can-I-Recover-A-Deleted-Message-on-Discord-3"><a href="#1-Can-I-Recover-A-Deleted-Message-on-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

When it is downloaded, click on the Better Discord Windows installer. Next, read the license agreement and click on the Next option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Then click install better Discord and hit the next button. Choose the Discord version that you currently have installed.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Open Discord and click on the user settings. There, you will see the Better Discord section. Next, click on the Plugin option. Now, close the Discord window and drag the animated status dot plugin into the plugin folder that opened after clicking on the Plugin option.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Go to Discord again, and you will see the Animated Status option. Enable it and click on the gear icon. To add an animated emoji, click on the + icon. Next, you will see a Nitro ID field. Then, go to a chat page and click on the emoji option.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Look at the emoji that you like and memorize the animated emoji name. Press \ followed by the name of the emoji. Now, copy the whole text and paste it again. You will see a few numbers; that’s the Nitro ID for the emoji. Copy the number only, go back to the Animated plugin and paste it on the Nitro ID field. Go back to the Nitro page again, and you will see the animated emoji on your status.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Custom-Discord-Status-Emoji-Ideas-3"><a href="#Part-5-Custom-Discord-Status-Emoji-Ideas-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Custom Discord Status Emoji Ideas"></a>Part 5: Custom Discord Status Emoji Ideas</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/custom-discord-status-emoji-ideas.jpg"                      alt="custom discord status emoji ideas"                ></p><p>If you want to make your Discord Status look really cool, you can get some custom Discord status emoji ideas from us.

A unique feature of this platform is that it facilitates community-based communication, where users who share certain interests can form their own private chats that are known as servers.</p><p>While its user interface is quite simple, Discord allows users to deploy a variety of advanced communication tools, from textual content to audio and video streams. It’s natural that users want to express their thoughts creatively, so there is a lot of genuine interest in learning how to change the visual look of the messages through the use of basic text formatting. In this article, we will discuss how to change text style in Discord and provide detailed instructions for activating various options, such as using bold or italic letters or underlining a part of the text.</p><p>Let’s start with the software module that makes it all possible.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#part1">Part 1: How Does Discord Text Engine Work?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Change Text Style in Discord with Markdown?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Use Code Block for Discord Text Formatting?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part5">Part 5: FAQs About Discord Text Formatting</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-How-Does-Discord-Text-Engine-Work"><a href="#Part-1-How-Does-Discord-Text-Engine-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How Does Discord Text Engine Work?"></a>Part 1: How Does Discord Text Engine Work?</h2><p>Beneath the surface, Discord runs on a powerful engine called Markdown, which regulates how text is displayed on the pages visible to users. It’s an application of markup language that completely depends on textual symbols as commands, making it quite simple for users who are not skilled at advanced programming to alter the look of the text.</p><p>Basically, Markdown allows you to enter a few symbols and it will interpret them as commands for changing the text style, for example bolding or underlying certain word or sentence. For highlighting blocks of text, there is a specific library named <a class="link"   href="https://highlightjs.org/" >Highlight.js <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that allows simple text marking for stylistic emphasis.</p><p>This approach is very practical and easy to learn, so long-time users of Discord are able to change text style as they type without thinking too much about it.

A unique feature of this platform is that it facilitates community-based communication, where users who share certain interests can form their own private chats that are known as servers.</p><p>While its user interface is quite simple, Discord allows users to deploy a variety of advanced communication tools, from textual content to audio and video streams. It’s natural that users want to express their thoughts creatively, so there is a lot of genuine interest in learning how to change the visual look of the messages through the use of basic text formatting.

It’s an application of markup language that completely depends on textual symbols as commands, making it quite simple for users who are not skilled at advanced programming to alter the look of the text.</p><p>Basically, Markdown allows you to enter a few symbols and it will interpret them as commands for changing the text style, for example bolding or underlying certain word or sentence. For highlighting blocks of text, there is a specific library named <a class="link"   href="https://highlightjs.org/" >Highlight.js <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that allows simple text marking for stylistic emphasis.</p><p>This approach is very practical and easy to learn, so long-time users of Discord are able to change text style as they type without thinking too much about it.

One way to do it is to deploy code blocks, which can be activated with the backtick character ( ` ) placed on the beginning and the end of a text section. This command will highlight the chosen part of the text while preserving blank space around it for extra emphasis of your message. However, if you use three consecutive ( ` ) signs before a block of text and separate the text into several lines by pressing enter, the result will be a series of highlighted lines that form a single code block. This option is simple enough that even beginners with no programming abilities can easily learn how to use it, and it has some practical applications that savvy Discord users are very fond of.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Change-the-Text-Color-in-Discord-Message-2"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Change-the-Text-Color-in-Discord-Message-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?"></a>Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?</h2><p>It’s not possible to alter the default text color from the native user interface in Discord. However, there is a simple solution to this problem that involves the highlight.is scrip mentioned earlier in the article. This Javascript-based library can transform the normal text into a code block consisting of three lines, where the middle line would be your selection of text in an alternative color. This is a neat workaround that’s very simple to activate using the same kind of text-based commands described above.</p><p>To change the text color, you should create a simple, three-line block. In the top line, you need to put three backtick characters (”’) along with a code phrase corresponding to the text color you would like to use. In the second line, you should type your entire text normally, while the bottom line should include three more backticks. You can create new lines by pressing the Shift and Enter keys at the same time.</p><p>Here is a detailed video tutorial for creating customized text in a range of different colors with all the relevant code phrases.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Discord-Text-Formatting-2"><a href="#FAQs-About-Discord-Text-Formatting-2" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Discord Text Formatting"></a>FAQs About Discord Text Formatting</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-the-default-Discord-font-2"><a href="#1-What-is-the-default-Discord-font-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

One way to do it is to deploy code blocks, which can be activated with the backtick character ( ` ) placed on the beginning and the end of a text section. This command will highlight the chosen part of the text while preserving blank space around it for extra emphasis of your message. However, if you use three consecutive ( ` ) signs before a block of text and separate the text into several lines by pressing enter, the result will be a series of highlighted lines that form a single code block. This option is simple enough that even beginners with no programming abilities can easily learn how to use it, and it has some practical applications that savvy Discord users are very fond of.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Change-the-Text-Color-in-Discord-Message-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Change-the-Text-Color-in-Discord-Message-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?"></a>Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?</h2><p>It’s not possible to alter the default text color from the native user interface in Discord. However, there is a simple solution to this problem that involves the highlight.is scrip mentioned earlier in the article. This Javascript-based library can transform the normal text into a code block consisting of three lines, where the middle line would be your selection of text in an alternative color. This is a neat workaround that’s very simple to activate using the same kind of text-based commands described above.</p><p>To change the text color, you should create a simple, three-line block. In the top line, you need to put three backtick characters (”’) along with a code phrase corresponding to the text color you would like to use. In the second line, you should type your entire text normally, while the bottom line should include three more backticks. You can create new lines by pressing the Shift and Enter keys at the same time.</p><p>Here is a detailed video tutorial for creating customized text in a range of different colors with all the relevant code phrases.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Discord-Text-Formatting-3"><a href="#FAQs-About-Discord-Text-Formatting-3" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Discord Text Formatting"></a>FAQs About Discord Text Formatting</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-the-default-Discord-font-3"><a href="#1-What-is-the-default-Discord-font-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

What is the default Discord font?</h4><p>Discord uses the same basic font all over the entire platform, including all chats between users and in your profile info. This is Uni sans font, which is quite simple and belongs to the sans serif family of fonts that are known for good readability on almost any background.</p><h4 id="2-How-do-you-get-different-fonts-on-Discord-3"><a href="#2-How-do-you-get-different-fonts-on-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

How to make a hidden text in Discord?</h4><p>The creation of a hidden text message that requires direct user action to reveal is possible in Discord and requires a so-called spoiler tag. If you precede your message with the text &#x2F;spoiler or type two slash bars ( &#x2F;&#x2F;) at either side, it will be hidden from other users except for those who decide to view it and indicate their desire by clicking or tapping on it. Messages of this kind appear highlighted with gray background in the message stream on a Discord chat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-discover-the-pathway-earning-your-place-as-a-validated-disco-partner/"><u>In 2024, Discover the Pathway  Earning Your Place as a Validated Disco Partner</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/pinpointing-perfect-workplace-messengers-is-slack-surpassing-discord-for-2024/"><u>Pinpointing Perfect Workplace Messengers  Is Slack Surpassing Discord for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-discord-from-basics-to-advanced/"><u>2024 Approved  The Ultimate Guide to Discord  From Basics to Advanced</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-10-budget-friendly-discovoice-alternatives-for-discord-users/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top 10 Budget-Friendly DiscoVoice Alternatives for Discord Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-compilation-of-tips-for-incorporating-gifs-into-discord-conversations/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Compilation of Tips for Incorporating GIFs Into Discord Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-incorporating-roles-into-your-discord-server/"><u>In 2024, Step-by-Step  Incorporating Roles Into Your Discord Server</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/how-to-modify-your-discord-display-at-a-glance/"><u>How to Modify Your Discord Display at a Glance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-complete-guide-to-building-a-captivating-discord-pfp/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Complete Guide to Building a Captivating Discord PFP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-everything-on-discord-stickers-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Everything on Discord Stickers  A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/elevate-your-discord-presence-mobile-and-desktop-streaming-for-2024/"><u>Elevate Your Discord Presence  Mobile & Desktop Streaming for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-sync-up-soundtracks-connecting-spotify-to-discord-effortlessly/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Sync Up Soundtracks  Connecting Spotify to Discord Effortlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-the-best-top-10-for-dating-in-discord/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling the Best  Top 10 for Dating in Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-foremost-5-animated-logos-for-interactive-channels/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Foremost 5 Animated Logos for Interactive Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-abandoned-ending-my-discord-service/"><u>[New] Abandoned  Ending My Discord Service</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/peerless-bots-crafted-for-chats-for-2024/"><u>Peerless Bots Crafted for Chats for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-no-cost-no-problem-here-are-the-10-best-for-discord-voice-captures/"><u>In 2024, No Cost, No Problem?

At this point, you may be wondering, what does Discord Nitro do?</p><p>Though upgrading is not a requirement as most features do not require a subscription, free users still have certain limitations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-pricing.jpg"                      alt=" Discord Nitro pricing"                ></p><p>For instance, they can’t use the same emojis on two servers.

And if you pick a yearly subscription plan, you’ll get a 16% discount.</p><p>The two Discord Nitro variants are Nitro Classic and Nitro!</p><p>If you choose the Nitro classic subscription service, you’ll have to pay $4.99 on the monthly plan or $49.99 annually. This variant is comparatively cheaper than the Nitro and provides stripped-down features.</p><p>On the other hand, if you go for the Nitro subscription service, get ready to pay $99.99 on the yearly plan and $9.99 on the monthly. It offers many features to its users.</p><p>Both these variants provide loads of advantages to discord users; here are a handful of benefits the two paid subscription services offer:</p><ul><li>If you choose the free version, your screen share settings typically max out at the 720p resolution (30fps). However, if you select either of the two paid versions, you can share a screen with friends at 720p (60fps) resolution or 1080p resolution (30fps)</li><li>Go-Live provides users with limited streaming; it means you can stream games to users who don’t happen to be your friends, unlike screen-share. So, with a free version, you can stream at 720p (30fps), whereas, Nitro Classic subscription will allow you to stream up to 1080p resolution (60fps), and the Nitro will provide you with 60fps and more quality</li><li>With the free version, you can upload and share only 8MB size files. But with paid variants, you’ll get an increased uploading limit.

And this isn’t just limited to chatting but sometimes you’re going to want to share content, including videos.</p><p>So, whether it’s a compilation of your best gaming moments that you’ve carefully edited together, a home movie that you want to share with friends, or just a funny clip that someone’s sent you that you want to pass on, here we’ll take you through how to send videos on Discord both on PC and mobile, and the likely issues you might face.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Send Videos on Discord PC</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Send Videos on Discord Mobile</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Send Long Videos on Discord That Are More Than 8MB</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Send-Videos-on-Discord-PC"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Send-Videos-on-Discord-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Send Videos on Discord PC"></a>Part 1: How to Send Videos on Discord PC</h2><p>It’s actually pretty simple to send videos on Discord when using a PC, providing they aren’t too large a file size.</p><p>Firstly, you just need to navigate to the channel or private message where you want to send the video. Just find the right option on the list of servers you’re a member of, or head to your message inbox to find the user you want to send it to privately.</p><p>Once you’re in the right place, click on the plus (+) icon that you’ll find to the left of the chatbox at the bottom of the screen where you’d normally type your message.</p><p>You’ll then just need to find the file on your computer, and double click on it. It’ll then bring up a pop-up for the video where you can add a comment, which will sit above the video (ideal if you need to give context on why you’re sharing it). You can also mark it as a spoiler – useful if you’re sharing a gaming tip but you don’t want to spoil the story for anyone who’s not reached that point yet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/upload-video-discord-1.png"                      alt="upload videos to discord"                ></p><p>From there, it’s as simple as clicking the upload button. Once it’s ready, the video will be in the chat window for anyone in the server to watch, or for your friend if you’ve sent it privately. And if they want to download it, they’ll just need to click the download button (a downward-facing arrow) at the top right of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/upload-video-discord-2.png"                      alt="how to upload videos to discord"                ></p><p>It’s worth noting that, while Discord will play most video formats, it can’t manage everything. If you upload a format that Discord isn’t compatible with, then it won’t show a video player – instead, the file will just be uploaded. Other people can still download it to watch on their own devices.</p><p>Also, there’s a strict file limit of 8MB. This isn’t huge at all – while there’s no definitive file size for video (as it depends on file type, resolution, compression, etc) it’s unlikely to be more than 60 seconds of footage, and could just be a few seconds. If the video you want to upload is more than 8MB, carry on reading below to find out how.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Send-Videos-on-Discord-Mobile"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Send-Videos-on-Discord-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Send Videos on Discord Mobile"></a>Part 2: How to Send Videos on Discord Mobile</h2><p>The process to send video on Discord Mobile is pretty similar both with iOS and Android, but with just a few minor tweaks.</p><p>Firstly, you still need to navigate to either the server or inbox where you want to share the video. You can then click the ‘Photo Selector’ button directly to the left of the chatbox.</p><p>This will open your phone’s gallery, but it’ll only be searching for photos. You instead want the File Selector, which will be the third icon along – it looks like a text document with a folded-over corner.</p><p>Click this and it’ll give you the option to directly upload a video from your phone’s Downloads folder. To send a video that’s stored elsewhere, click on the Expand arrow at the top left of the menu. This will send you to your phone’s file navigation system where you can find the video you want.</p><p>Once you’ve selected the video, just hit the blue Send icon to send your video to the chat. Again you can add a message as a caption, but this time it’ll just be in the normal message box rather than a dedicated comment box before you hit upload.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Send-Long-Videos-on-Discord-That-Are-More-Than-8MB"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Send-Long-Videos-on-Discord-That-Are-More-Than-8MB" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Send Long Videos on Discord That Are More Than 8MB"></a>Part 3: How to Send Long Videos on Discord That Are More Than 8MB</h2><p>So as we’ve said above, there is a file size limit when you’re using a free Discord account of just 8MB, which isn’t much at all. There are a few ways around this, so take your pick from the one that sounds best for you.</p><h4 id="1-Update-to-Discord-Nitro-to-Upload-100MB"><a href="#1-Update-to-Discord-Nitro-to-Upload-100MB" class="headerlink" title="1. Update to Discord Nitro to Upload 100MB"></a>1. Update to Discord Nitro to Upload 100MB</h4><p>The first option is possibly the simplest but it’s definitely not the cheapest, and that’s to pay for an upgrade to Discord Nitro. The paid version of Discord has a number of benefits, one of which is the increased file upload size of 100MB. It costs $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, so if you’re likely to be regularly uploading videos that are lower than this limit, it might make sense.</p><h4 id="2-Cut-Unwanted-Clips-Compress-Video-with-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#2-Cut-Unwanted-Clips-Compress-Video-with-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="2. Cut Unwanted Clips&#x2F;Compress Video with Filmora Video Editor"></a>2. Cut Unwanted Clips&#x2F;Compress Video with Filmora Video Editor</h4><p>The second choice would be to take your video and cut it into pieces, sending them one at a time. This might sound time-consuming but with Filmora’s Instant Cutter Tool, it’s really simple.</p><p>All you need to do is open a video in Filmora by clicking the arrow next to Import and then choosing ‘Import with Instant Cutter Tool’.</p><p>This will open the Instant Cutter window where you can click Open File to add your video. From here you can trim your files and export them in multiple sections. There are different ways that you can do this, and while each is a simple process, there are still a few steps to follow.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>For more detail, check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >this post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a step-by-step guide on the different ways you can trim a video in Filmora.</p><p>You can also try to compress your video size, which may let you keep the whole video at the expense of some of the quality. Again, using Filmora, this is easy. But also again, there are different ways to go about it.</p><p>You could literally crop the video in order to trim some of the data, as the reduced viewing screen won’t be as big a file. You can also reduce the resolution, or convert your video to a format that uses fewer data. You’ll need to test it though, as converting to some video formats might result in blurry footage.</p><p>There are advanced settings you can tinker with too, such as lowering the frame rate or the bit rate. Again, rather than go through all of those options in an epic article here, it’s easier to head to a post dedicated to these steps about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >compress videos with Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="3-Upload-to-YouTube-Vimeo-Google-Drive-Dropbox"><a href="#3-Upload-to-YouTube-Vimeo-Google-Drive-Dropbox" class="headerlink" title="3. Upload to YouTube&#x2F;Vimeo&#x2F;Google Drive&#x2F;Dropbox"></a>3. Upload to YouTube&#x2F;Vimeo&#x2F;Google Drive&#x2F;Dropbox</h4><p>The final option is to upload your video to an online player or storage site, and link to it, rather than having Discord host the file. YouTube and Vimeo are the obvious options, but Streamable is another popular choice too with a free membership. YouTube’s maximum video uploads are 128GB, which is huge, while other sites like Streamable cap free accounts to 500MB per video.</p><p>So, if you want to upload massive files, you’ll need to decide whether to choose YouTube or pay for an upgraded membership elsewhere. Wherever you host your video, once it’s online just grab the link and paste it into Discord to share your content.</p><p>The only drawback to this option is that it stops other users from being able to download the video directly, and you may need to look at a file sharing alternative such as Dropbox if you want to send the actual file.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Uploading-Videos-to-Discord"><a href="#FAQs-About-Uploading-Videos-to-Discord" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord"></a>FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord</h2><h4 id="Which-Kind-of-Video-Formats-Can-I-Upload-to-Discord"><a href="#Which-Kind-of-Video-Formats-Can-I-Upload-to-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Which Kind of Video Formats Can I Upload to Discord?"></a>Which Kind of Video Formats Can I Upload to Discord?</h4><p>You can send any filetype to another user on Discord, so that they can download it and watch it on their own device. But if you want to upload a video so that Discord embeds it, and makes it playable within the chat, you’re limited to only mp4 and WebM filetypes.</p><p>You can also use MOV files, but not everyone will be able to play them, and FLAC files are supported on desktop only but not on mobile.</p><h4 id="How-Can-I-Upload-Saved-Videos-to-Discord"><a href="#How-Can-I-Upload-Saved-Videos-to-Discord" class="headerlink" title="How Can I Upload Saved Videos to Discord?"></a>How Can I Upload Saved Videos to Discord?</h4><p>If you find a video on Discord that you want to share on a different server or in a private DM, you can use the download icon to save it locally. Then, follow the steps above to upload the video to the server or DM chat window where you want to share it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>The whole point of Discord is to bring together communities of like-minded people to talk, share ideas and have fun together.

There are different ways that you can do this, and while each is a simple process, there are still a few steps to follow.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>For more detail, check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >this post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a step-by-step guide on the different ways you can trim a video in Filmora.</p><p>You can also try to compress your video size, which may let you keep the whole video at the expense of some of the quality. Again, using Filmora, this is easy. But also again, there are different ways to go about it.</p><p>You could literally crop the video in order to trim some of the data, as the reduced viewing screen won’t be as big a file. You can also reduce the resolution, or convert your video to a format that uses fewer data. You’ll need to test it though, as converting to some video formats might result in blurry footage.</p><p>There are advanced settings you can tinker with too, such as lowering the frame rate or the bit rate.

Since Discord serves to enable groups of friends or people with shared interests to communicate in real-time, standing out from the crowd and establishing a well-known and well-liked persona can be very challenging. Every element of presence on the platform contributes to the overall impression the user will make, and his profile picture is definitely one of the most impactful elements that go a long way towards identity building.</p><p><em><strong>It’s important to note that Discord users can only use a single profile picture or avatar on the platform, and can’t switch them from one server to another.</strong></em> This rule serves to establish some accountability and familiarity and applies even to server administrators. With that in mind, choosing a great image to represent you everywhere on the Discord platform is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly.

On the other hand, too small images won’t be legible and can look bad due to pixelization. The most optimal image size you should use for your Discord profile photo is at least <strong>512 x 512 pixels</strong> – enough to be clearly visible and far above the <strong>180 x 180-pixel minimum</strong>.</p><p>You don’t have to use your real photo or likeness for your Discord avatar – in fact, you don’t have to use a realistic image at all. Discord allows the use of photographs as well as various types of illustrations and cartoon images and accepts JPG as well as the animated GIF format.</p><p>This gives you a lot of freedom to craft your new identity and uses some powerful imagery, either created from scratch or taken from the internet. However, there are still some community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your submission for a profile picture might be rejected for failing to meet Discord’s T&amp;C.</p><p>Basically, no NSFW images are allowed on Discord so you will have to avoid anything extreme or controversial. Pornographic content or explicit nudity is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions or promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality. You also need to stay away from violent imagery or anything depicting illegal activity, including drug use, racial discrimination, or mistreatment of animals. While this eliminates a lot of content, it still leaves enough room to express yourself freely without risking offending any other Discord users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-Download"><a href="#Part-2-Discord-Profile-Pictures-Download" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download"></a>Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download</h2><p>If you want to download a cool Discord profile picture, you can check the following websites:</p><h4 id="1-discordavatars-com"><a href="#1-discordavatars-com" class="headerlink" title="1. discordavatars.com"></a>1. discordavatars.com</h4><p>This website collects free Discord avatars and profile pictures, which allow you to download without any limitations.

Since Discord serves to enable groups of friends or people with shared interests to communicate in real-time, standing out from the crowd and establishing a well-known and well-liked persona can be very challenging. Every element of presence on the platform contributes to the overall impression the user will make, and his profile picture is definitely one of the most impactful elements that go a long way towards identity building.</p><p><em><strong>It’s important to note that Discord users can only use a single profile picture or avatar on the platform, and can’t switch them from one server to another.</strong></em> This rule serves to establish some accountability and familiarity and applies even to server administrators. With that in mind, choosing a great image to represent you everywhere on the Discord platform is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly. To help you do this the right way while respecting all the rules, we prepared a detailed guide for this process.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#part1">Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part2">Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Create A Discord Avatar in Filmora?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#part5">Part 5: Frequently Asked Questions About Discord PFP</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance-1"><a href="#Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance"></a>Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</h2><p>Like all other social networks and online communication services, Discord has a set of rules determining whether a certain image is suitable for use as an avatar.</p><p>First of all, you have to adhere to a size limit for technical reasons, as too large images would slow down the channel.

Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?"></a>1. Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?</h4><p>If you experience this problem, it’s most likely a consequence of trying to make too many picture changes too fast. While Discord will allow you to upload two profile images in rapid succession, the third attempt within a few minutes is going to be unsuccessful. The problem will disappear if you wait for a short period of time and try uploading again. Another reason might be that your firewall is preventing you from using an image from a cloud server, but you can easily bypass the issue and download the picture first to your hard disc before uploading it to Discord from there.</p><h4 id="2-How-can-I-find-my-old-profile-picture-3"><a href="#2-How-can-I-find-my-old-profile-picture-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

If you see a green dot, the user is available to chat at the moment. A yellow dot indicated an idle user that hasn’t been active in a while, and the red color means the user is busy and doesn’t want to be disturbed. Finally, a gray dot confirms that the user is currently not signed in to his Discord account.</p><h4 id="4-Can-I-use-different-avatars-on-different-Discord-servers-3"><a href="#4-Can-I-use-different-avatars-on-different-Discord-servers-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

In this example we’ll be using Among Us Manager Bot as an example.</p><p>After going to the Website, click the invite link button. Some websites might not have a button to “invite link”. In that case, look for a different button like “invite/add” etc.</p><p>After you click the button, you’ll have to sign in to your discord account and it will then ask which server you wish to add the bot to.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/connect-among-us-manager-to-discord.jpg"                      alt="Connect Among Us Manager  Bot to Discord "                ></p><p>Just select a server and then click continue.</p><p>Next, it’ll ask what permissions you want to give to the bot. Go over this carefully and select the ones you want. But you may lose some functions if a certain permission isn’t given.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/connect-among-us-manager-to-discord-permission-settings.jpg"                      alt="Connect Among Us Manager  Bot to Discord Permission Settings"                ></p><p>Click Authorize. It will then ask you to verify whether you’re human or not. If you pass this little test, the bot will be added to your selected server.</p><p>You can then go over to your server in discord and found your bot there.</p><p>Now all that’s left is getting your friends and hoping into a fun filled and thrilled game of the murder mystery game Among Us.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>In the end, all the Among Us bots are basically used to mute players and unmute them at certain points so that there is no cheating and everyone can play the game fairly and it doesn’t get ruined because of some toxic rotten tomatoes.</p><p><img

However, as servers become crowded, they get bombarded with texts. And some of these texts have spoilers for games (or other stuff) that others may not want to know or read. But ignoring spoilers was not that easy. As you scroll miles and miles of texts, your eyes are bound to catch some hints and ruin the suspense for you.</p><p>Thankfully, Discord came out with the perfect solution. Now, if you are sharing some spoilers or secrets, you can mark them as spoilers. The result is a text that is sent but is blacked out. Curious users who are not scared of spoilers can view it. Others can enjoy their bliss of ignorance.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Use Spoilers on Discord to Hide Text Messages?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Add Spoiler to Image and Video on Discord?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Bonus: Is it the same to use Spoiler on Mobile devices?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Bonus: How to turn off the Spoiler tag?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Use-Spoilers-on-Discord-to-Hide-Text-Messages"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Use-Spoilers-on-Discord-to-Hide-Text-Messages" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Use Spoilers on Discord to Hide Text Messages?"></a>Part 1: How to Use Spoilers on Discord to Hide Text Messages?</h2><p>And now we come to the point - <strong>how to do spoilers on Discord</strong>? Well, there are two ways to do it. You can run through both of them and choose whichever suits you the best. All the methods are simple to follow. Note that some are available only on the desktop.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Adding-Spoiler-Text-Via-Tag-on-Discord"><a href="#Method-1-Adding-Spoiler-Text-Via-Tag-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Adding Spoiler Text Via Tag on Discord"></a>Method 1: Adding Spoiler Text Via Tag on Discord</h3><p>We will begin with the tag method. All you have to do is add the spoiler tag on Discord. Here is a quick rundown of the steps –</p><ol><li>Open the Discord app and log in using your credentials.</li><li>Pick a server from your server list or a friend from the friend list.</li><li>Type whatever you want to in the chatbox.</li><li>Now add the ‘||’ symbols before and after the spoiler content. For instance, it will look something like this – Hey! This is a spoiler ||spoiler alert||</li><li>Hit the enter key to send and your spoiler is sent without spoiling anything!</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoiler-tag-discord.jpg"                      alt="add spoiler tag to Discord  "                ></p><p>This works for the Discord desktop app, browser, and also mobile app. This is like a universal method of hiding spoilers.</p><p>You can also add ‘&#x2F;spoiler’ before the spoiler content. This is an alternative to the ‘||’ we add at the start and the end.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoiler-tag-slash-discord.jpg"                      alt="add spoiler tag slash to Discord "                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Sending-Spoiler-Message-with-Mark-as-Spoiler-icon"><a href="#Method-2-Sending-Spoiler-Message-with-Mark-as-Spoiler-icon" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Sending Spoiler Message with Mark as Spoiler icon"></a>Method 2: Sending Spoiler Message with Mark as Spoiler icon</h3><p>This alternate method is quite simple. This was a recent update on Discord that enables you to add the spoiler tag quickly. Here is a brief rundown for you –</p><ol><li>Type out the spoiler content in the chatbox.</li><li>Select the spoiler part of the text (highlight it).</li><li>Upon selection, a floating bar will appear. Click the ‘eye’ symbol. and then the ‘||’ mark will immediately accompany the selected text, and the selected message will be spoiled automatically.</li><li>After you hit the send button, the text will be sent to the server. Only the people who wish to see the spoiler will tap on it unveil it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoiler-icon.jpg"                      alt="add spoiler marker on Discord"                ></p><p>This method is available only on the Discord desktop app and browser version. For iOS, the steps are similar. The only difference is that you have to select the spoiler mark from the context menu.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Spoiler-to-Image-and-Video-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Spoiler-to-Image-and-Video-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add Spoiler to Image and Video on Discord?"></a>Part 2: How to Add Spoiler to Image and Video on Discord?</h2><p>There are many scenarios where a <strong>Discord spoiler</strong> can come in handy. As you might be aware that Discord is quite popular and its cross-platform flexibility make it a favorite among gamers. You can connect to your friends over multiple devices with a single account.</p><p>Just like texts, even images, videos, and other attachments can be marked as spoilers. The process of marking images and videos as spoilers differs slightly from that of texts. So, how to add spoiler tags to other files?

Slack is more business-centric as it emphasizes text chat, file transfers, and project collaboration, with a slightly more formal structure.</p><p>If you’re looking for a more social-media-oriented network, where you can communicate with your peers easily in an informal manner, Discord is the right app for you. It is a dream for gamers, and now even for people collaborating at work!</p><p>However, if you’re looking for an app that caters more to work-related purposes, with a large number of integrations, and a text-oriented layout, Slack will serve you well.

So, there’s no saying that one app serves only one specific purpose.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-7"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-7" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Discord <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is popular among gamers as they use it to connect with team members, stream their play, and interact within the community.</p><p>Though, that is not to say that Discord is useless for non-gaming purposes.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Slack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>offers a pretty similar scope of use to Discord as a group chat application. However, it only caters to working individuals looking to liaison for projects and communicate effortlessly for work-related tasks.</p><p>Although they may be similar in a lot of ways, which is better for your needs? Let’s compare them in detail and find out!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Discord-Vs-Slack-Pricing-3"><a href="#Part-1-Discord-Vs-Slack-Pricing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Discord Vs. Slack Pricing"></a>Part 1: Discord Vs. Slack Pricing</h2><p>Pricing is where Slack takes a hit. If you’re low on budget, Discord is definitely a better option. Slack users must pay for a subscription, with the plans starting from $6.67 per month for simple features, such as removing the limit of 10,000 searchable messages and 10 integrations.</p><p>For extended features, such as guest access, 99.99% uptime, and 24&#x2F;7 customer care, customers will have to shell out $12.5 per month.</p><p>In contrast, Discord offers <strong>free access</strong> to users with pretty much no limitations. Users can keep their team’s message history in the free version and generally access most of the features.</p><p>However, if you want extra perks, such as higher screen sharing quality, extras space, or <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >animated emojis <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can subscribe to the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Discord Nitro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> plan. <strong>Slack vs. Discord has a clear winner if you’re only considering the price point: Discord!</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-pricing.jpg"                      alt="Discord Nitro Pricing"                ></p><p><em>Discord has a Nitro plan that provides unfiltered service, whereas it is still completely usable without it.</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-pricing.jpg"                      alt="Slack  Pricing"                ></p><p><em>Slack has various limits to features on three different levels</em></p><h2 id="Part-2-Discord-Vs-Slack-Interface-3"><a href="#Part-2-Discord-Vs-Slack-Interface-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Discord Vs. Slack Interface"></a>Part 2: Discord Vs. Slack Interface</h2><p>Both apps share many similarities in their template and interface. Users will find their contacts on the left and conversations on the right on both apps.</p><p>However, Slack’s interface is much more user-friendly and concise, with all the DMs, apps, and channels visible on the right.</p><p>In contrast, users might be initially thrown off by Discord due to its more complicated nature. If they want to access channels and direct messages, they will have to find them through different menus.</p><p>But compared to Slack, users will find it easier to customize their <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Discord profile <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. They can add different theme colors and a light mode.</p><p>Slack’s customization options also offer variety, but applying the changes can be quite cumbersome because of the complicated format. Discord is more intuitive when compared to Slack in terms of use.</p><p>Also, what you see as servers in Discord are essentially teams in Slack, and switching teams in Slack is more complicated than changing Discord servers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-interface.jpg"                      alt="Discord interface   "                ></p><p>Lastly, when using Discord, you can join and leave servers at will, while you will have to go through an onboarding process for each team in Slack.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-preferences-settings.jpg"                      alt="Slack  interface"                ></p><p>Slack vs. Discord is so hotly contested because of their similarities, and the interface is the biggest one of them all!</p><h2 id="Part-3-Discord-Vs-Slack-Conversations-3"><a href="#Part-3-Discord-Vs-Slack-Conversations-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Discord Vs. Slack Conversations"></a>Part 3: Discord Vs. Slack Conversations</h2><p>Slack gives users the liberty to communicate in various ways, including direct messages, public conversations, and private channels.</p><p>In contrast, Discord channels only allow for communication using text and voice. Channel <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >members can be assigned specific roles, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and users can also communicate via private channels.</p><p>Moreover, Slack does not have an official limit for team members, while Discord does have a server limit of 500,000 members.</p><p>If the number of online members exceeds 250,000, users need to contact Discord support for extra server space.</p><p><strong>Image</strong>: <em>Discord (left) and Slack (right) also have a very similar way to send direct messages to various accounts</em></p><h2 id="Part-4-Slack-Vs-Discord-Video-Call-3"><a href="#Part-4-Slack-Vs-Discord-Video-Call-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Slack Vs. Discord Video Call"></a>Part 4: Slack Vs. Discord Video Call</h2><p>Discord is known for its <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >voice calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, allowing users to access special voice channels to just join and start speaking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video call   "                ></p><p>This feature is desirable to gamers who want to interact with friends in between games. Users can speak to 5,000 people simultaneously and see up to 9 friends at a time.</p><p>In contrast, Slack offers quite basic video calling features, missing out on crucial features like noise suspension and echo cancellation, which Discord offers.</p><p>Also, Discord offers a push-to-talk feature where users can turn their mics on during gaming sessions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-video-conferencing.jpg"                      alt="Slack Video Conferencing "                ></p><p><em>On Discord (left), the video call hub will drop down from the top, whereas, on Slack (left), the hub appears in the middle of the screen</em></p><p>Both of these apps do not feature built-in voice messaging. Slack does offer the luxury of recording voice messages, but that requires third-party integration. Discord completely misses out on this feature.</p><p>If we were to rate the two apps for video calling features, <strong>Discord seems to come out on top, offering many advanced features for its users.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-5-Discord-Vs-Slack-File-Sharing-3"><a href="#Part-5-Discord-Vs-Slack-File-Sharing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Discord Vs. Slack File Sharing"></a>Part 5: Discord Vs. Slack File Sharing</h2><p>Users can share files on both Discord and Slack, with the size limit of files being the main difference.</p><p>With Discord, users can share files up to 8MB, but upgrading to the Nitro plan increases this limit to 15MB. In contrast, Slack allows users to share files up to 1GB.</p><p>However, Slack users cannot save these shared files forever, while Discord allows their users to save unlimited messages and file history.</p><p>This feature is handy if users need to access the files they shared in the past. They can also subscribe to the Nitro plan for longer backlogs and get a 50MB limit per file instead of the 8MB in the free version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-screen-sharing-friends.jpg"                      alt="Discord screensharing   "                ></p><p>With Slack, users can even share Google Drive, along with code and text snippets, which is a valuable feature for business and work-related file-sharing.</p><p>In contrast, users can only share files from their own device on Discord. However, it is necessary to confirm before sharing files in both apps, which can be cumbersome for large file transfers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-screen-sharing.jpg"                      alt="Slack screensharing   "                ></p><p><em>The file-sharing prompt on Discord (left) and Slack (right) is also somewhat similar, with both providing instant sharing by holding down the Shift button</em></p><h2 id="Part-6-Discord-Vs-Slack-Screen-Sharing-3"><a href="#Part-6-Discord-Vs-Slack-Screen-Sharing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Discord Vs.

For paid users, the limit extends to 15 people.</p><p>It allows anyone to share their screen on a video call, regardless of their payment plan, and users can access both video and voice calls with the same button.</p><p>Discord also allows users to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >share their screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with other members, giving them the luxury to share their entire screen, a particular window, or gameplay with up to 9 people at a time, without making any changes to the settings.</p><p><strong>Image</strong>: <em>The screen sharing tools on Discord (Left) are more descriptive and provide more options than those for Slack (Left)</em></p><h2 id="Part-7-Discord-Vs-Slack-Summary-3"><a href="#Part-7-Discord-Vs-Slack-Summary-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Discord Vs. Slack Summary"></a>Part 7: Discord Vs. Slack Summary</h2><p>When it comes to video calling and file-sharing, both apps can boast their qualities, catering to different target audiences and serving various purposes.</p><p>Discord prioritizes voice chat, where gamers can communicate with their friends while playing games. Slack is more business-centric as it emphasizes text chat, file transfers, and project collaboration, with a slightly more formal structure.</p><p>If you’re looking for a more social-media-oriented network, where you can communicate with your peers easily in an informal manner, Discord is the right app for you. It is a dream for gamers, and now even for people collaborating at work!</p><p>However, if you’re looking for an app that caters more to work-related purposes, with a large number of integrations, and a text-oriented layout, Slack will serve you well. It’s an adequate team chat app for businesses and organizations.</p><p>At the end of the day, <strong>Slack vs. Discord</strong> is a fight whose victor is down to the user. What app you choose depends on your purpose and the goal you want to achieve.</p><p>And although Discord is well-placed to be the future of communications, as it stands, some gamers use Slack, and some businessmen use Discord.

At the very bottom of the screen, you’ll see the “delete account” option</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-delete-account-option.jpg"                      alt="Delete Discord Account Permantely - Account Options"                ></p><ol><li>Click the delete account button to make your Discord account disappear!</li></ol><p>However, if you’ve activated 2FA, you may also be asked to put your password and 2FA code.</p><p>Also, if you want to delete your account permanently, there are some things you need to do before completing the process.</p><p>As mentioned before, if you’re the server’s owner, you’ll have to either delete your server or transfer its ownership to a trusted source.</p><p>For transferring ownership on Discord, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Open the Discord app</li><li>Click the “server name,” and a range of options will open; then click “server setting”</li><li>At the bottom-left of the screen, click the ‘members’ option below “User Management”</li><li>Here you’ll make the critical decision of who gets the keys to your kingdom. Once you decide who to transfer the ownership to, click the “3 vertical dots”</li><li>As the “dialog menu” opens, click “Transfer Ownership”</li></ol><p>Once it’s completed, you’ll become a regular server member. Your access to the server will be limited and as per the set position.</p><p>On the other hand, if you don’t want to transfer its ownership to someone else, you can also delete it.</p><p>Here’s how you can delete the server to complete the process of deleting your Discord account:</p><ol><li>Click the “Server Name” again</li><li>Within the several options, click the “Server Settings.”</li><li>At the bottom-left of your window, click the “Delete Server” option in the “User Management” section.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-discord-server-account.jpg"                      alt="Delete Discord Server to Delete Account"                ></p><ol><li>Once clicked, the system will ask you to enter the account password to delete your server (or servers) from existence altogether</li></ol><p>Like the primary Discord account deletion process, if you have enabled 2FA on this account, you’ll have to put in the code to get things completed.</p><p>After this, you’ll be asked one more time to click the “delete server” button before it is completely deleted. Keep in mind that you’ll have 14 days time to recover your Discord account. Once the two-week time passes, you won’t be able to retrieve or sign in to your account.</p><p>Once the account is deleted, the username will show up as “deleteduser 0000” or something similar to this. However, users you have texted via your account will still see your texts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Delete-Discord-Account-From-iPhone-And-Android-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Delete-Discord-Account-From-iPhone-And-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Delete Discord Account From iPhone And Android?"></a>Part 2: How to Delete Discord Account From iPhone And Android?</h2><p>Yes, you can delete the discord account from iPhone and Android.

Game players and other users can instantly create voice or text servers for enhanced communication.</p><p>Discord provides excellent flexibility to users by providing high-quality audio services with no background noise. Even if your friends are in different parts of the world, you can chat with them smoothly.

The live streaming on Discord won’t be a public show, as it will only be confined to your selected server. Through this, you can ask your friends for assistance while playing games.

Hence, it’s a great platform for professionals, game lovers, and other individuals to communicate efficiently.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Prerequisites-for-Stream-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-Prerequisites-for-Stream-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Prerequisites for Stream on Discord"></a>Part 2: Prerequisites for Stream on Discord</h2><p>Many social media platforms put restrictions on users for live streaming.

Slack Summary</h2><p>When it comes to video calling and file-sharing, both apps can boast their qualities, catering to different target audiences and serving various purposes.</p><p>Discord prioritizes voice chat, where gamers can communicate with their friends while playing games. Slack is more business-centric as it emphasizes text chat, file transfers, and project collaboration, with a slightly more formal structure.</p><p>If you’re looking for a more social-media-oriented network, where you can communicate with your peers easily in an informal manner, Discord is the right app for you. It is a dream for gamers, and now even for people collaborating at work!</p><p>However, if you’re looking for an app that caters more to work-related purposes, with a large number of integrations, and a text-oriented layout, Slack will serve you well. It’s an adequate team chat app for businesses and organizations.</p><p>At the end of the day, <strong>Slack vs. Discord</strong> is a fight whose victor is down to the user. What app you choose depends on your purpose and the goal you want to achieve.</p><p>And although Discord is well-placed to be the future of communications, as it stands, some gamers use Slack, and some businessmen use Discord.

Slack Interface"></a>Part 2: Discord Vs. Slack Interface</h2><p>Both apps share many similarities in their template and interface. Users will find their contacts on the left and conversations on the right on both apps.</p><p>However, Slack’s interface is much more user-friendly and concise, with all the DMs, apps, and channels visible on the right.</p><p>In contrast, users might be initially thrown off by Discord due to its more complicated nature. If they want to access channels and direct messages, they will have to find them through different menus.</p><p>But compared to Slack, users will find it easier to customize their <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Discord profile <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. They can add different theme colors and a light mode.</p><p>Slack’s customization options also offer variety, but applying the changes can be quite cumbersome because of the complicated format. Discord is more intuitive when compared to Slack in terms of use.</p><p>Also, what you see as servers in Discord are essentially teams in Slack, and switching teams in Slack is more complicated than changing Discord servers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-interface.jpg"                      alt="Discord interface   "                ></p><p>Lastly, when using Discord, you can join and leave servers at will, while you will have to go through an onboarding process for each team in Slack.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-preferences-settings.jpg"                      alt="Slack  interface"                ></p><p>Slack vs. Discord is so hotly contested because of their similarities, and the interface is the biggest one of them all!</p><h2 id="Part-3-Discord-Vs-Slack-Conversations-3"><a href="#Part-3-Discord-Vs-Slack-Conversations-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Discord Vs. Slack Conversations"></a>Part 3: Discord Vs. Slack Conversations</h2><p>Slack gives users the liberty to communicate in various ways, including direct messages, public conversations, and private channels.</p><p>In contrast, Discord channels only allow for communication using text and voice. Channel <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >members can be assigned specific roles, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and users can also communicate via private channels.</p><p>Moreover, Slack does not have an official limit for team members, while Discord does have a server limit of 500,000 members.</p><p>If the number of online members exceeds 250,000, users need to contact Discord support for extra server space.</p><p><strong>Image</strong>: <em>Discord (left) and Slack (right) also have a very similar way to send direct messages to various accounts</em></p><h2 id="Part-4-Slack-Vs-Discord-Video-Call-3"><a href="#Part-4-Slack-Vs-Discord-Video-Call-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Slack Vs. Discord Video Call"></a>Part 4: Slack Vs. Discord Video Call</h2><p>Discord is known for its <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >voice calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, allowing users to access special voice channels to just join and start speaking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video call   "                ></p><p>This feature is desirable to gamers who want to interact with friends in between games. Users can speak to 5,000 people simultaneously and see up to 9 friends at a time.</p><p>In contrast, Slack offers quite basic video calling features, missing out on crucial features like noise suspension and echo cancellation, which Discord offers.</p><p>Also, Discord offers a push-to-talk feature where users can turn their mics on during gaming sessions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-video-conferencing.jpg"                      alt="Slack Video Conferencing "                ></p><p><em>On Discord (left), the video call hub will drop down from the top, whereas, on Slack (left), the hub appears in the middle of the screen</em></p><p>Both of these apps do not feature built-in voice messaging. Slack does offer the luxury of recording voice messages, but that requires third-party integration. Discord completely misses out on this feature.</p><p>If we were to rate the two apps for video calling features, <strong>Discord seems to come out on top, offering many advanced features for its users.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-5-Discord-Vs-Slack-File-Sharing-3"><a href="#Part-5-Discord-Vs-Slack-File-Sharing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Discord Vs. Slack File Sharing"></a>Part 5: Discord Vs. Slack File Sharing</h2><p>Users can share files on both Discord and Slack, with the size limit of files being the main difference.</p><p>With Discord, users can share files up to 8MB, but upgrading to the Nitro plan increases this limit to 15MB. In contrast, Slack allows users to share files up to 1GB.</p><p>However, Slack users cannot save these shared files forever, while Discord allows their users to save unlimited messages and file history.</p><p>This feature is handy if users need to access the files they shared in the past. They can also subscribe to the Nitro plan for longer backlogs and get a 50MB limit per file instead of the 8MB in the free version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-screen-sharing-friends.jpg"                      alt="Discord screensharing   "                ></p><p>With Slack, users can even share Google Drive, along with code and text snippets, which is a valuable feature for business and work-related file-sharing.</p><p>In contrast, users can only share files from their own device on Discord. However, it is necessary to confirm before sharing files in both apps, which can be cumbersome for large file transfers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-screen-sharing.jpg"                      alt="Slack screensharing   "                ></p><p><em>The file-sharing prompt on Discord (left) and Slack (right) is also somewhat similar, with both providing instant sharing by holding down the Shift button</em></p><h2 id="Part-6-Discord-Vs-Slack-Screen-Sharing-3"><a href="#Part-6-Discord-Vs-Slack-Screen-Sharing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Discord Vs. Slack Screen Sharing"></a>Part 6: Discord Vs. Slack Screen Sharing</h2><p>Slack restricts video calls to two people, except for users who have subscribed to an extension plan. For paid users, the limit extends to 15 people.</p><p>It allows anyone to share their screen on a video call, regardless of their payment plan, and users can access both video and voice calls with the same button.</p><p>Discord also allows users to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >share their screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with other members, giving them the luxury to share their entire screen, a particular window, or gameplay with up to 9 people at a time, without making any changes to the settings.</p><p><strong>Image</strong>: <em>The screen sharing tools on Discord (Left) are more descriptive and provide more options than those for Slack (Left)</em></p><h2 id="Part-7-Discord-Vs-Slack-Summary-3"><a href="#Part-7-Discord-Vs-Slack-Summary-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Discord Vs. Slack Summary"></a>Part 7: Discord Vs. Slack Summary</h2><p>When it comes to video calling and file-sharing, both apps can boast their qualities, catering to different target audiences and serving various purposes.</p><p>Discord prioritizes voice chat, where gamers can communicate with their friends while playing games. Slack is more business-centric as it emphasizes text chat, file transfers, and project collaboration, with a slightly more formal structure.</p><p>If you’re looking for a more social-media-oriented network, where you can communicate with your peers easily in an informal manner, Discord is the right app for you. It is a dream for gamers, and now even for people collaborating at work!</p><p>However, if you’re looking for an app that caters more to work-related purposes, with a large number of integrations, and a text-oriented layout, Slack will serve you well. It’s an adequate team chat app for businesses and organizations.</p><p>At the end of the day, <strong>Slack vs. Discord</strong> is a fight whose victor is down to the user. What app you choose depends on your purpose and the goal you want to achieve.</p><p>And although Discord is well-placed to be the future of communications, as it stands, some gamers use Slack, and some businessmen use Discord. So, there’s no saying that one app serves only one specific purpose.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Soon, it became a popular chat forum for people who obsess over music, movies, art, and anime fans.</p><p>Initially, Discord served as a voice channel for Gamers. However, today it is much more than that. It has bots, streaming features, voice channels, and many more personalization tools that make your server an intimate Hangout.</p><p>Using Discord without joining a server is as good as not using Discord at all. But if you are a newbie, you might find it difficult to join a server with active users. Not all servers are good, and this guide will help you filter out the best servers on Discord.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Find-Discord-Server-on-Explore-Public-Servers-tab"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Find-Discord-Server-on-Explore-Public-Servers-tab" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Find Discord Server on Explore Public Servers tab"></a>Part 1: How to Find Discord Server on Explore Public Servers tab</h2><p>The obvious questions that you will encounter after signing up on Discord are - <strong>How to find a Discord server</strong>? Is it difficult? Do I have to fill up an application?</p><p>One of the popular and easiest ways to find servers is to use explore Public Servers function. Here is a brief rundown of the steps -</p><ol><li>Open the Discord app on your desktop visit the site.</li><li>Tap the compass symbol to open the explore public service option.</li><li>You will be directed towards the official Discord server directory. It has a search box on the top. Many top servers are listed below. Popular games like Minecraft, Fortnite, Call of Duty, and more are listed. You can tap open any of these channels to explore the community.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-community-on-discord-explore-public-server.jpg"                      alt="Find Discord Server   "                ></p><ol><li>Likewise, you can enter some search terms in a search box and explore the channels related to the term. For instance, you can input the term ‘Disney Movies’ or ‘Call of Duty’ and hit the search button.
