But sometimes you want to do more than just chat using text messaging, which is where <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video calling <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes in handy.</p><p>Discord has video call options built into the desktop app, the web browser and the mobile app, so you don’t need to switch between different software when you want to chat on video with your friends or colleagues. Read on to find out how to make a video call on Discord.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Best Settings for Discord Video Call</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Make a Server Video Call on Discord?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs about Discord Video Call</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Settings-for-Discord-Video-Call"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Settings-for-Discord-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Settings for Discord Video Call"></a>Part 1: Best Settings for Discord Video Call</h2><p>Before you start calling everyone, you’ll want to check your settings to make sure you have the best experience. It’s important to make sure you’ve got your best equipment setup to work for the highest quality audio and video possible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg"                      alt="Discord User Settings option"                ></p><p>So, start by heading to the User Settings page. You’ll find this at the bottom left of the screen – look for the cog icon next to your name. You won’t see this on mobile, this is only on the desktop app and the web browser version of Discord.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-settings.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video Call Settings "                ></p><p>Once you’ve opened settings, you’ll want to click on the <strong>Voice &amp; Video</strong> tab. Here you can check your microphone settings and adjust the volume, and choose your camera. If you’re using an external camera instead of the built-in option, check that the right one is selected in the dropdown.</p><p>You can also use this opportunity to run a test video – so that you know you’re well-lit, properly framed and otherwise good to go. You can adjust the lighting in your room or move the camera if you don’t feel it’s quite right.</p><p>One quick note for the web browser version of Discord – you’ll be asked to grant permission to your microphone and camera. Make sure you allow the site to use your equipment otherwise it won’t work on the video call.</p><p>Once you are happy, just click the close button at the top right of the settings options.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Private-Video-Call-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Private-Video-Call-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?"></a>Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?</h2><p>Once you’ve got your settings ready, you’re set to make your private Discord video call. If you’re doing it on the web browser or desktop app, you’ll need to first navigate to the inbox you share with the person you want to call. Do this by clicking on the Home button at the top left – you’ll then get a list of all your contacts.</p><p>If you’re only calling one person then it’s easy – just click on their name.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-discord-friend.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video Call with Friends "                ></p><p>If you want to call a private group, you need to click the + button and then create a group DM. Add the names of the users you want to call.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friend-group-video-call-discord.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video Call with group "                ></p><p>Once you’re in the direct message window of the person or group you want to call, you need to look at the buttons at the top right of the screen. The second icon that looks like a video camera is the one you’re looking for. Click that and you’ll start a video call.</p><p>You’ll see yourself on screen at this point, but you’ll need to wait until the other person or group members have joined the call for the chat to properly begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg"                      alt="Discord Video Call interface"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925549/19272" target="_top" id="1925549">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925549" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925549/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The process of making video call on Discord mobile is essentially identical.

Once you’re there, you’ll need to join the voice channel that you should see on the left side of the screen.</p><p>Once you’re in the voice channel, click Lounge, Community Hangout or Stream Room, and then switch on your camera by clicking the ‘Video’ button. You’ll find this at the bottom-left of the screen. Again, if you’re on the web browser, you’ll be asked by your browser for permission to use your camera at this stage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-video-call.jpg"                      alt="Discord Server Video Call  "                ></p><p>And that’s it – the video call is now live and anyone who joins the voice channel will be able to see you, chat to you and switch on their camera to join the video conference as well.</p><p>On mobile, it’s slightly different. You’ll still want to head to the server you want to join and then click on the voice channel to join it. But as soon as you click on the voice channel, you’ll get a pop-up with an icon at the bottom right where you can instantly switch on your camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-video-call-mobile.jpg"                      alt="Discord Server Video Call on mobile  "                ></p><p>If you prefer, you can still just join as voice, and then at any stage click on your name where you’ll be able to then switch on your camera to turn a voice chat into a video call.</p><p>Whenever you want to end the video call, just click on your name again to switch off your camera, or disconnect completely from the voice channel.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Discord-Video-Chat-Call"><a href="#FAQs-About-Discord-Video-Chat-Call" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Discord Video Chat Call"></a>FAQs About Discord Video Chat Call</h2><h4 id="1-How-Many-People-Can-Join-in-the-Discord-Group-Video-Call"><a href="#1-How-Many-People-Can-Join-in-the-Discord-Group-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="1.

You’ll find this at the bottom left of the screen – look for the cog icon next to your name.

You can adjust the lighting in your room or move the camera if you don’t feel it’s quite right.</p><p>One quick note for the web browser version of Discord – you’ll be asked to grant permission to your microphone and camera. Make sure you allow the site to use your equipment otherwise it won’t work on the video call.</p><p>Once you are happy, just click the close button at the top right of the settings options.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Private-Video-Call-on-Discord-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Private-Video-Call-on-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?"></a>Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?</h2><p>Once you’ve got your settings ready, you’re set to make your private Discord video call.

Even if your friends are in different parts of the world, you can chat with them smoothly. You can create private and public servers in Discord to communicate with people having similar interests.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-on-discord-1.jpg"                      alt="discord interface"                ></p><p>Along with using Discord Voice and Text chat features, you can live stream your gameplays.

While the application earlier required you to create an avatar or an emoji from scratch, it now offers the option of selecting a picture and generating emojis and stickers.</p><p> You can make changes or adjustments to your emoji if it’s not what you imagined it to be. You may do this by directly customizing the appearance of your avatar. That includes changing hair, color, size or shape, and much more.</p><p>Furthermore, with Bitmoji you can:</p><ul><li>Create an expressive avatar</li><li>Choose from a vast library of emojis</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/discord-emoji-maker-4.jpg"                      alt="discord emoji maker - BITMOJI"                ></p><h3 id="2-ZMOJI"><a href="#2-ZMOJI" class="headerlink" title="2.  ZMOJI"></a>2.  ZMOJI</h3><p>This application is the perfect fit for you if you want to create and easily share customizable emojis with your friends. This is also used as a Discord emoji maker, but it may remind old users of the Bitmoji application, where you had no automated guidance.</p><p>You were left clear to experiment and use your creativity to start in and make emojis for yourself from scratch.</p><p>There is almost nothing in the application that you are not able to adjust.</p><p>This includes changing or adjusting the avatar features such as eyebrows and hairstyle to face type and clothing.</p><p>Once you’ve created ZMoji emojis for yourself, you can download them and send them over to your Discord server for upload.</p><p>ZMoji keyboard, an extension of the ZMoji application, is a must if you love animated emojis. It offers an extensive range of stickers, and you won’t run out of options anytime soon.</p><p>However, some users might find that the biggest drawback of ZMoji is the number of ads on the platform and that the cost of a premium subscription is a touch more expensive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/discord-emoji-maker-5.jpg"                      alt="discord emoji maker on mobile - ZMOJI"                ></p><h3 id="3-EMOJILY"><a href="#3-EMOJILY" class="headerlink" title="3.

Pretty cool, right?</p><p>With Emojily, you have all the tools available to run your creativity wild and make the best emoji present.</p><p>While The Create Emoji is a free, customized extension of Emojily, you can only access limited elements in the free version.

This can throw people off the track or confuse them for a while.</li><li>Control yourself and try not to tell anyone that you are leaving.</li><li>And now it’s time for the discreet farewell!</li></ul><p>You might still get some texts on personal asking about your exit. This is not a surefire way of making your exit a secret. However, hundreds of members along with bots will make your disappearance less apparent. Another solution would be to create a new user ID and leave the old one inactive.</p><ol><li>Does leaving a Discord server delete your messages?</li></ol><p>No, none of the texts that you sent on the server get deleted. Every text remains, even after you leave. The only way you can delete your texts if you delete them all one by one, or someone with sufficient permissions deletes them. If you get banned, then the member who banned you decides whether to keep your messages on the server or remove them.

Just find the right option on the list of servers you’re a member of, or head to your message inbox to find the user you want to send it to privately.</p><p>Once you’re in the right place, click on the plus (+) icon that you’ll find to the left of the chatbox at the bottom of the screen where you’d normally type your message.</p><p>You’ll then just need to find the file on your computer, and double click on it. It’ll then bring up a pop-up for the video where you can add a comment, which will sit above the video (ideal if you need to give context on why you’re sharing it). You can also mark it as a spoiler – useful if you’re sharing a gaming tip but you don’t want to spoil the story for anyone who’s not reached that point yet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/upload-video-discord-1.png"                      alt="upload videos to discord"                ></p><p>From there, it’s as simple as clicking the upload button. Once it’s ready, the video will be in the chat window for anyone in the server to watch, or for your friend if you’ve sent it privately. And if they want to download it, they’ll just need to click the download button (a downward-facing arrow) at the top right of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/upload-video-discord-2.png"                      alt="how to upload videos to discord"                ></p><p>It’s worth noting that, while Discord will play most video formats, it can’t manage everything. If you upload a format that Discord isn’t compatible with, then it won’t show a video player – instead, the file will just be uploaded. Other people can still download it to watch on their own devices.</p><p>Also, there’s a strict file limit of 8MB. This isn’t huge at all – while there’s no definitive file size for video (as it depends on file type, resolution, compression, etc) it’s unlikely to be more than 60 seconds of footage, and could just be a few seconds. If the video you want to upload is more than 8MB, carry on reading below to find out how.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Send-Videos-on-Discord-Mobile"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Send-Videos-on-Discord-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Send Videos on Discord Mobile"></a>Part 2: How to Send Videos on Discord Mobile</h2><p>The process to send video on Discord Mobile is pretty similar both with iOS and Android, but with just a few minor tweaks.</p><p>Firstly, you still need to navigate to either the server or inbox where you want to share the video. You can then click the ‘Photo Selector’ button directly to the left of the chatbox.</p><p>This will open your phone’s gallery, but it’ll only be searching for photos. You instead want the File Selector, which will be the third icon along – it looks like a text document with a folded-over corner.</p><p>Click this and it’ll give you the option to directly upload a video from your phone’s Downloads folder. To send a video that’s stored elsewhere, click on the Expand arrow at the top left of the menu. This will send you to your phone’s file navigation system where you can find the video you want.</p><p>Once you’ve selected the video, just hit the blue Send icon to send your video to the chat. Again you can add a message as a caption, but this time it’ll just be in the normal message box rather than a dedicated comment box before you hit upload.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130528/26400" target="_top" id="2130528">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130528" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130528/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Send-Long-Videos-on-Discord-That-Are-More-Than-8MB"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Send-Long-Videos-on-Discord-That-Are-More-Than-8MB" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Send Long Videos on Discord That Are More Than 8MB"></a>Part 3: How to Send Long Videos on Discord That Are More Than 8MB</h2><p>So as we’ve said above, there is a file size limit when you’re using a free Discord account of just 8MB, which isn’t much at all. There are a few ways around this, so take your pick from the one that sounds best for you.</p><h4 id="1-Update-to-Discord-Nitro-to-Upload-100MB"><a href="#1-Update-to-Discord-Nitro-to-Upload-100MB" class="headerlink" title="1. Update to Discord Nitro to Upload 100MB"></a>1. Update to Discord Nitro to Upload 100MB</h4><p>The first option is possibly the simplest but it’s definitely not the cheapest, and that’s to pay for an upgrade to Discord Nitro. The paid version of Discord has a number of benefits, one of which is the increased file upload size of 100MB. It costs $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, so if you’re likely to be regularly uploading videos that are lower than this limit, it might make sense.</p><h4 id="2-Cut-Unwanted-Clips-Compress-Video-with-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#2-Cut-Unwanted-Clips-Compress-Video-with-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="2. Cut Unwanted Clips&#x2F;Compress Video with Filmora Video Editor"></a>2. Cut Unwanted Clips&#x2F;Compress Video with Filmora Video Editor</h4><p>The second choice would be to take your video and cut it into pieces, sending them one at a time. This might sound time-consuming but with Filmora’s Instant Cutter Tool, it’s really simple.</p><p>All you need to do is open a video in Filmora by clicking the arrow next to Import and then choosing ‘Import with Instant Cutter Tool’.</p><p>This will open the Instant Cutter window where you can click Open File to add your video. From here you can trim your files and export them in multiple sections. There are different ways that you can do this, and while each is a simple process, there are still a few steps to follow.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>For more detail, check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >this post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a step-by-step guide on the different ways you can trim a video in Filmora.</p><p>You can also try to compress your video size, which may let you keep the whole video at the expense of some of the quality. Again, using Filmora, this is easy. But also again, there are different ways to go about it.</p><p>You could literally crop the video in order to trim some of the data, as the reduced viewing screen won’t be as big a file. You can also reduce the resolution, or convert your video to a format that uses fewer data. You’ll need to test it though, as converting to some video formats might result in blurry footage.</p><p>There are advanced settings you can tinker with too, such as lowering the frame rate or the bit rate. Again, rather than go through all of those options in an epic article here, it’s easier to head to a post dedicated to these steps about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >compress videos with Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="3-Upload-to-YouTube-Vimeo-Google-Drive-Dropbox"><a href="#3-Upload-to-YouTube-Vimeo-Google-Drive-Dropbox" class="headerlink" title="3. Upload to YouTube&#x2F;Vimeo&#x2F;Google Drive&#x2F;Dropbox"></a>3. Upload to YouTube&#x2F;Vimeo&#x2F;Google Drive&#x2F;Dropbox</h4><p>The final option is to upload your video to an online player or storage site, and link to it, rather than having Discord host the file. YouTube and Vimeo are the obvious options, but Streamable is another popular choice too with a free membership. YouTube’s maximum video uploads are 128GB, which is huge, while other sites like Streamable cap free accounts to 500MB per video.</p><p>So, if you want to upload massive files, you’ll need to decide whether to choose YouTube or pay for an upgraded membership elsewhere. Wherever you host your video, once it’s online just grab the link and paste it into Discord to share your content.</p><p>The only drawback to this option is that it stops other users from being able to download the video directly, and you may need to look at a file sharing alternative such as Dropbox if you want to send the actual file.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Uploading-Videos-to-Discord"><a href="#FAQs-About-Uploading-Videos-to-Discord" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord"></a>FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord</h2><h4 id="Which-Kind-of-Video-Formats-Can-I-Upload-to-Discord"><a href="#Which-Kind-of-Video-Formats-Can-I-Upload-to-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Which Kind of Video Formats Can I Upload to Discord?"></a>Which Kind of Video Formats Can I Upload to Discord?</h4><p>You can send any filetype to another user on Discord, so that they can download it and watch it on their own device. But if you want to upload a video so that Discord embeds it, and makes it playable within the chat, you’re limited to only mp4 and WebM filetypes.</p><p>You can also use MOV files, but not everyone will be able to play them, and FLAC files are supported on desktop only but not on mobile.</p><h4 id="How-Can-I-Upload-Saved-Videos-to-Discord"><a href="#How-Can-I-Upload-Saved-Videos-to-Discord" class="headerlink" title="How Can I Upload Saved Videos to Discord?"></a>How Can I Upload Saved Videos to Discord?</h4><p>If you find a video on Discord that you want to share on a different server or in a private DM, you can use the download icon to save it locally. Then, follow the steps above to upload the video to the server or DM chat window where you want to share it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>The whole point of Discord is to bring together communities of like-minded people to talk, share ideas and have fun together.

This isn’t huge at all – while there’s no definitive file size for video (as it depends on file type, resolution, compression, etc) it’s unlikely to be more than 60 seconds of footage, and could just be a few seconds.

You can then click the ‘Photo Selector’ button directly to the left of the chatbox.</p><p>This will open your phone’s gallery, but it’ll only be searching for photos. You instead want the File Selector, which will be the third icon along – it looks like a text document with a folded-over corner.</p><p>Click this and it’ll give you the option to directly upload a video from your phone’s Downloads folder. To send a video that’s stored elsewhere, click on the Expand arrow at the top left of the menu. This will send you to your phone’s file navigation system where you can find the video you want.</p><p>Once you’ve selected the video, just hit the blue Send icon to send your video to the chat.

And this isn’t just limited to chatting but sometimes you’re going to want to share content, including videos.</p><p>So, whether it’s a compilation of your best gaming moments that you’ve carefully edited together, a home movie that you want to share with friends, or just a funny clip that someone’s sent you that you want to pass on, here we’ll take you through how to send videos on Discord both on PC and mobile, and the likely issues you might face.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Send Videos on Discord PC</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Send Videos on Discord Mobile</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Send Long Videos on Discord That Are More Than 8MB</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Send-Videos-on-Discord-PC-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Send-Videos-on-Discord-PC-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Send Videos on Discord PC"></a>Part 1: How to Send Videos on Discord PC</h2><p>It’s actually pretty simple to send videos on Discord when using a PC, providing they aren’t too large a file size.</p><p>Firstly, you just need to navigate to the channel or private message where you want to send the video. Just find the right option on the list of servers you’re a member of, or head to your message inbox to find the user you want to send it to privately.</p><p>Once you’re in the right place, click on the plus (+) icon that you’ll find to the left of the chatbox at the bottom of the screen where you’d normally type your message.</p><p>You’ll then just need to find the file on your computer, and double click on it. It’ll then bring up a pop-up for the video where you can add a comment, which will sit above the video (ideal if you need to give context on why you’re sharing it). You can also mark it as a spoiler – useful if you’re sharing a gaming tip but you don’t want to spoil the story for anyone who’s not reached that point yet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/upload-video-discord-1.png"                      alt="upload videos to discord"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049379/7443" target="_top" id="2049379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>From there, it’s as simple as clicking the upload button. Once it’s ready, the video will be in the chat window for anyone in the server to watch, or for your friend if you’ve sent it privately. And if they want to download it, they’ll just need to click the download button (a downward-facing arrow) at the top right of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/upload-video-discord-2.png"                      alt="how to upload videos to discord"                ></p><p>It’s worth noting that, while Discord will play most video formats, it can’t manage everything. If you upload a format that Discord isn’t compatible with, then it won’t show a video player – instead, the file will just be uploaded. Other people can still download it to watch on their own devices.</p><p>Also, there’s a strict file limit of 8MB. This isn’t huge at all – while there’s no definitive file size for video (as it depends on file type, resolution, compression, etc) it’s unlikely to be more than 60 seconds of footage, and could just be a few seconds. If the video you want to upload is more than 8MB, carry on reading below to find out how.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134499/19576" target="_top" id="2134499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134499/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Send-Videos-on-Discord-Mobile-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Send-Videos-on-Discord-Mobile-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Send Videos on Discord Mobile"></a>Part 2: How to Send Videos on Discord Mobile</h2><p>The process to send video on Discord Mobile is pretty similar both with iOS and Android, but with just a few minor tweaks.</p><p>Firstly, you still need to navigate to either the server or inbox where you want to share the video. You can then click the ‘Photo Selector’ button directly to the left of the chatbox.</p><p>This will open your phone’s gallery, but it’ll only be searching for photos. You instead want the File Selector, which will be the third icon along – it looks like a text document with a folded-over corner.</p><p>Click this and it’ll give you the option to directly upload a video from your phone’s Downloads folder. To send a video that’s stored elsewhere, click on the Expand arrow at the top left of the menu. This will send you to your phone’s file navigation system where you can find the video you want.</p><p>Once you’ve selected the video, just hit the blue Send icon to send your video to the chat. Again you can add a message as a caption, but this time it’ll just be in the normal message box rather than a dedicated comment box before you hit upload.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Send-Long-Videos-on-Discord-That-Are-More-Than-8MB-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Send-Long-Videos-on-Discord-That-Are-More-Than-8MB-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Send Long Videos on Discord That Are More Than 8MB"></a>Part 3: How to Send Long Videos on Discord That Are More Than 8MB</h2><p>So as we’ve said above, there is a file size limit when you’re using a free Discord account of just 8MB, which isn’t much at all. There are a few ways around this, so take your pick from the one that sounds best for you.</p><h4 id="1-Update-to-Discord-Nitro-to-Upload-100MB-3"><a href="#1-Update-to-Discord-Nitro-to-Upload-100MB-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Update to Discord Nitro to Upload 100MB"></a>1. Update to Discord Nitro to Upload 100MB</h4><p>The first option is possibly the simplest but it’s definitely not the cheapest, and that’s to pay for an upgrade to Discord Nitro. The paid version of Discord has a number of benefits, one of which is the increased file upload size of 100MB. It costs $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, so if you’re likely to be regularly uploading videos that are lower than this limit, it might make sense.</p><h4 id="2-Cut-Unwanted-Clips-Compress-Video-with-Filmora-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#2-Cut-Unwanted-Clips-Compress-Video-with-Filmora-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Cut Unwanted Clips&#x2F;Compress Video with Filmora Video Editor"></a>2. Cut Unwanted Clips&#x2F;Compress Video with Filmora Video Editor</h4><p>The second choice would be to take your video and cut it into pieces, sending them one at a time. This might sound time-consuming but with Filmora’s Instant Cutter Tool, it’s really simple.</p><p>All you need to do is open a video in Filmora by clicking the arrow next to Import and then choosing ‘Import with Instant Cutter Tool’.</p><p>This will open the Instant Cutter window where you can click Open File to add your video. From here you can trim your files and export them in multiple sections. There are different ways that you can do this, and while each is a simple process, there are still a few steps to follow.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>For more detail, check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >this post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a step-by-step guide on the different ways you can trim a video in Filmora.</p><p>You can also try to compress your video size, which may let you keep the whole video at the expense of some of the quality. Again, using Filmora, this is easy. But also again, there are different ways to go about it.</p><p>You could literally crop the video in order to trim some of the data, as the reduced viewing screen won’t be as big a file. You can also reduce the resolution, or convert your video to a format that uses fewer data. You’ll need to test it though, as converting to some video formats might result in blurry footage.</p><p>There are advanced settings you can tinker with too, such as lowering the frame rate or the bit rate. Again, rather than go through all of those options in an epic article here, it’s easier to head to a post dedicated to these steps about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >compress videos with Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="3-Upload-to-YouTube-Vimeo-Google-Drive-Dropbox-3"><a href="#3-Upload-to-YouTube-Vimeo-Google-Drive-Dropbox-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Upload to YouTube&#x2F;Vimeo&#x2F;Google Drive&#x2F;Dropbox"></a>3. Upload to YouTube&#x2F;Vimeo&#x2F;Google Drive&#x2F;Dropbox</h4><p>The final option is to upload your video to an online player or storage site, and link to it, rather than having Discord host the file. YouTube and Vimeo are the obvious options, but Streamable is another popular choice too with a free membership. YouTube’s maximum video uploads are 128GB, which is huge, while other sites like Streamable cap free accounts to 500MB per video.</p><p>So, if you want to upload massive files, you’ll need to decide whether to choose YouTube or pay for an upgraded membership elsewhere. Wherever you host your video, once it’s online just grab the link and paste it into Discord to share your content.</p><p>The only drawback to this option is that it stops other users from being able to download the video directly, and you may need to look at a file sharing alternative such as Dropbox if you want to send the actual file.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Uploading-Videos-to-Discord-3"><a href="#FAQs-About-Uploading-Videos-to-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord"></a>FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord</h2><h4 id="Which-Kind-of-Video-Formats-Can-I-Upload-to-Discord-3"><a href="#Which-Kind-of-Video-Formats-Can-I-Upload-to-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="Which Kind of Video Formats Can I Upload to Discord?"></a>Which Kind of Video Formats Can I Upload to Discord?</h4><p>You can send any filetype to another user on Discord, so that they can download it and watch it on their own device.
