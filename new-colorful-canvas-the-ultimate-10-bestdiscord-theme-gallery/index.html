<p>Discord is a communication software that allows users, mostly gamers, to communicate in real-time with clear lag-free voice chat and text chat and exchange information. It is available for free but requires you to buy Discord-Nitro to access more features.</p>

Below is a list of programs that you can try to find perfect one for you.</p>
<h3 id="Discord-Alternatives-Best-For-Gamer-Chatting-1"><a href="#Discord-Alternatives-Best-For-Gamer-Chatting-1" class="headerlink" title="Discord Alternatives Best For Gamer Chatting"></a><strong>Discord Alternatives Best For Gamer Chatting</strong></h3><h4 id="1-TeamSpeak-1"><a href="#1-TeamSpeak-1" class="headerlink" title="1  TeamSpeak"></a>1  TeamSpeak</h4><p>TeamSpeak is a proprietary voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) application for audio communication between users on a voice channel, very almost like a call. Users typically use headphones with a microphone. It has been around since 2002 and hence is widely trusted by the community.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="discord alternative for gamers - teamspeak"
                ></p>
<p>It allows crystal clear and lag free communication with 3D immersive features that help gamers who play real simulation games like Arma 3 to feel more involved with the radio feature and more. TeamSpeak is available on Window, Mac and on Mobile Devices.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages that TeamSpeak offers that make it better than the rest are:</p>
<ul>

<li>Military Grade Encryption</li>

<h4 id="2-Mumble-1"><a href="#2-Mumble-1" class="headerlink" title="2 Mumble"></a>2 Mumble</h4><p>Mumble is a voice IP application primarily designed to be employed by gamers and is analogous to programs like TeamSpeak. Mumble uses a client–server architecture which allows users to speak to each other via an equivalent server. It has a really simple administrative interface and features high sound quality and low latency. It has been around since 2005 but they released the stable version in October 2020.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="discord alternative for gamers - Mumble"
                ></p>
<p>Mumble is quite similar to TeamSpeak in it’s features and abilities. But in addition to that, it provides a large list of features separate to each kind of user from End-users to Hosters.</p>
<p>Users use Mumble for realism with their positional audio. This means that the farther one is, the more difficult it would be to receive their audio signals. And so Eve Online Players have servers with almost 100 active voice participants at a time. Mumbleis available on Window, Mac and on Mobile Devices.</p>
<p>Some more advantages that Mumble offers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low Latency - Great for Gaming</li>
<li>Privacy - Always Encrypted Communication</li>
<li>Open Source</li>
<li>Extensive User Permission System (ACL)</li>
<li>Free Software - No Licensing or Cost (even for Hosters)</li>

                      alt="discord alternative for gamers - Ventrilo"
                ></p>
<p>Ventrilo is best known for its superior sound quality and minimal use of CPU resources so as to not interfere with normal operations of the pc or during online game competitions. It is also preferred for the straightforward interface that any first time person can very quickly learn because the foremost commonly used features are immediately visible and can be activated with one click of the mouse.</p>
<p>Ventrilo uses a client-server based connection that’s always encrypted. User data isn’t collected or stored, hence it can’t be shared&#x2F;sold to external entities. All text-chat communications&#x2F;audio-recordings are stored locally on the Client computer. Ventrilo is available on Windows, Mac and even Linux. As for mobile users, it’s available on Apple Store and also for android but android users will have to download an APK which can be done from its website.</p>
