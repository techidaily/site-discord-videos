Every millisecond in the video should be engaging and how you do that is left to your creativity. You can keep it professional or fun-filled! Be creative and make sure to think out of the box. Remember your competitors will also be thinking of animated logos, so how will you grab the attention of users is very important. Remember less is more!</p>

<p>The Clownfish voice changer for discord looks a little basic, but it is all worth it to keep things simple. It is not a sophisticated tool, but it does everything right. It would be nice if it had more voices or features but it is not a big problem.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is freeware and doesn’t require a free subscription or account sign-in</p>
<p>Works for all versions of windows</p>
<p>Setup is pretty easy and fast</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>There are no added voice effects except the custom pitch function</p>
<p>Some voices make certain accents difficult to understand</p>
<p>Has a limited girl voice changer for discord</p>

                ></p>
<p>With plenty of features, added effects and built in sounds, this voice changer for discord PC is one of the finest available. It may have made it to the top of this list if it didn’t restrict so many of its features to the paid version. The free version is good, but it pales in comparison to the paid process version.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Uses very little bandwidth and CPU power</p>
<p>Has sound effects you can throw into the mix</p>
<p>Custom shortcuts make using this tool easier</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Paid subscription version is very expensive</p>
<p>The interface shape looks weird and clunky</p>
<p>Slightly unintuitive install process</p>

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>The voice changing faculties work very well. If you are using this program to change your voice in real time, then it sounds good. If you are using it to change your recorded voice, then it sounds amazing. In fact, if this article were about finding a voice changer for recorded voices, rather than finding a free voice changer for discord live chat, then VoiceMod would win by a significant amount.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The voices you produce sound great</p>
<p>Professionally designed and easy to installs</p>
<p>Flexible with plenty of uses</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The free version locks off too many features</p>
<p>App and website needs proofreading for its many written mistakes</p>
<p>Seems to hide paid version until you have actually downloaded</p>

                ></p>
<p>On the surface, the Voxal program is the best, but it has its annoying flaws. Installing cleanly is seemingly could be easier, and the program is not difficult to use. However, the free version is very limited. Many of the voices and many of the voice-manipulation tools are locked off from free users.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Has a low CPU usage</p>
<p>The interface is pretty easy to understand</p>
<p>Add effects to live and recorded voices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Compatibility with Steam games is hit and miss</p>
<p>Clean ad-free installs of the free version is tricky</p>
<p>Some voices sound too similar to bother with</p>

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>This program has an easy-to-use system, and its interface would be lovely if not for a few poorly chosen fonts. The sad part is that this tool is tricky to find, especially if you want a non-Android version. This is because the tool doesn’t have its own website, so numerous websites seem to hold it, but they are not easy websites to find.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Connecting with Discord is very easy</p>
<p>Picking a voice is simple and fast</p>
<p>Very low CPU usage</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Difficult to install</p>
<p>Finding stable or reliable versions can be tricky</p>
<p>The developer Ovia Games is out of business</p>

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>This is a very lightweight tool, and it uses very little CPU power. But, that shouldn’t dissuade you from using it because it has three voices that you can warp and manipulate. The level at which you can manipulate them is very deep. Play with the settings until you find the voice you like, and then save your settings for next time.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Allows for fairly deep customization</p>
<p>Save your settings for easy use next time</p>
<p>Loads quickly and doesn’t use much CPU power</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Tricky to install correctly</p>
<p>Needs a better help section</p>
<p>Difficult to figure out what some functions do</p>

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>The program is pretty advanced, but is more geared towards Skype, which is why it appears so low in this list. Getting your hands on the free version is pretty tricky, but you will find free options on the website. The interface is pretty intuitive to most tech-savvy people.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<p>The voice morphing tools are pretty advanced</p>
<p>Has various paid and free trial options for flexibility</p>
<p>You can customize the settings for a better output quality</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<p>The three paid versions are unfairly priced</p>
<p>Many functions on this tool will not be used by Discord users</p>
<p>Needs a strong tutorial section</p>

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>This is a fine voice changer that changes your live voice and your recorded voice. The program is let down by how it uses its free services to push its paid in-app functions onto you. Be careful where you download this tool from because there are many websites offering this tool and some of them are offering a malicious download.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The parrot function repeats things back and is funny</p>
<p>Save and share your creations</p>
<p>Three different modes and 32 voice options</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface looks a little dated</p>
<p>It has in-app purchases that are unfair</p>
<p>The free voices available are very limited</p>

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>This tool is actually rather good, but it is rather difficult to get it to work with discord. You need to make it so that the sound output is directed into Discord. Plus, it was custom-made for Smartphones and so looks clunky on desktops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Has a robust number of voices</p>
<p>Allows you to save your recordings</p>
<p>Pretty easy to understand how it works</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Slight lag when changing voices</p>
<p>Wants access to your external storage (your memory card)</p>
<p>Linking it up with Discord is tricky</p>

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>Use this program online while you have Discord active. It probably wouldn’t be as low on this list if it didn’t make it clearer how to use this with Discord. In short, you have to use the microphone via this website and have the output directed into the Discord system.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Some of the voices sound very funny in a laugh-out-loud way</p>
<p>Many people agree it is a good voice changer for discord</p>
<p>Can use the voices for commercial use without attribution</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting it to work with Discord is overly difficult</p>
<p>Some of the voices make you impossible to understand</p>
<p>The WTF voice is mostly just your words being jumbled</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Choose-the-Right-Free-Voice-Changer-for-Discord"><a href="#How-to-Choose-the-Right-Free-Voice-Changer-for-Discord" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose the Right Free Voice Changer for Discord?"></a>How to Choose the Right Free Voice Changer for Discord?</h2><ol>
<li><strong>Simple or Professional</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The free voice changer you choose depends upon your needs. If you are looking for something simple and quick, then pick a free open-source program. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to help you record and change your voice, then consider a program that has added paid versions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What Operation System You Use? Windows, Mac, or More</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The voice changer for Discord Mac versions are a little less common on the Internet. If you are a Mac user, then consider sticking to the app offerings on Apple-moderated marketplaces. Changing your voice for Discord isn’t a difficult task, so you should probably stay clear from paid programs if you are a Mac user.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What Voice Effects Do You Want?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are looking for a female voice changer for Discord, then mostly every voice changer will suit you. Every app&#x2F;program listed on this article has a female voice version. The reason for this is because a female voice is often considered higher pitched and lighter, and such a tone is available through all the apps&#x2F;programs listed above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Is It Easy to Get the Tool to Work?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are having a hard time getting the voice changer to work with Discord, then take a look online and especially on YouTube. There are often users on YouTube who have had the same problem and who are showing off a new solution.</p>
<p>If you are really struggling to find a solution, then look for ways to get pre-recorded content into Discord. Usually, the people who offer solutions on Google and Bing to this problem will also have the solution to getting your funny voice changer to work with Discord.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Does it Have a Free Trial?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the primary reasons why shouldn’t pay for a voice changer, at least at first, is because there is no guarantee that program will work. It is better if you download and try a free version or use a free trial. That way, if it doesn’t work, you haven’t lost anything.</p>
<p>Do not be fooled into thinking you have to pay for each tool. Many voice changers will make it seem like their only options are paid versions, but this is often not the case. Even those that do not have a free version will often have a free trial that you can exploit.</p>

<p>The Clownfish voice changer for discord looks a little basic, but it is all worth it to keep things simple. It is not a sophisticated tool, but it does everything right. It would be nice if it had more voices or features but it is not a big problem.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is freeware and doesn’t require a free subscription or account sign-in</p>
<p>Works for all versions of windows</p>
<p>Setup is pretty easy and fast</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>There are no added voice effects except the custom pitch function</p>
<p>Some voices make certain accents difficult to understand</p>
<p>Has a limited girl voice changer for discord</p>

                ></p>
<p>With plenty of features, added effects and built in sounds, this voice changer for discord PC is one of the finest available. It may have made it to the top of this list if it didn’t restrict so many of its features to the paid version. The free version is good, but it pales in comparison to the paid process version.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Uses very little bandwidth and CPU power</p>
<p>Has sound effects you can throw into the mix</p>
<p>Custom shortcuts make using this tool easier</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Paid subscription version is very expensive</p>
<p>The interface shape looks weird and clunky</p>
<p>Slightly unintuitive install process</p>
<h4 id="3-VoiceMod-1"><a href="#3-VoiceMod-1" class="headerlink" title="3. VoiceMod"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.voicemod.net/voice-changer-demos/" >VoiceMod <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>The voice changing faculties work very well. If you are using this program to change your voice in real time, then it sounds good. If you are using it to change your recorded voice, then it sounds amazing. In fact, if this article were about finding a voice changer for recorded voices, rather than finding a free voice changer for discord live chat, then VoiceMod would win by a significant amount.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The voices you produce sound great</p>
<p>Professionally designed and easy to installs</p>
<p>Flexible with plenty of uses</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The free version locks off too many features</p>
<p>App and website needs proofreading for its many written mistakes</p>
<p>Seems to hide paid version until you have actually downloaded</p>

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>On the surface, the Voxal program is the best, but it has its annoying flaws. Installing cleanly is seemingly could be easier, and the program is not difficult to use. However, the free version is very limited. Many of the voices and many of the voice-manipulation tools are locked off from free users.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Has a low CPU usage</p>
<p>The interface is pretty easy to understand</p>
<p>Add effects to live and recorded voices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Compatibility with Steam games is hit and miss</p>
<p>Clean ad-free installs of the free version is tricky</p>
<p>Some voices sound too similar to bother with</p>

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>This program has an easy-to-use system, and its interface would be lovely if not for a few poorly chosen fonts. The sad part is that this tool is tricky to find, especially if you want a non-Android version. This is because the tool doesn’t have its own website, so numerous websites seem to hold it, but they are not easy websites to find.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Connecting with Discord is very easy</p>
<p>Picking a voice is simple and fast</p>
<p>Very low CPU usage</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Difficult to install</p>
<p>Finding stable or reliable versions can be tricky</p>
<p>The developer Ovia Games is out of business</p>

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>This is a very lightweight tool, and it uses very little CPU power. But, that shouldn’t dissuade you from using it because it has three voices that you can warp and manipulate. The level at which you can manipulate them is very deep. Play with the settings until you find the voice you like, and then save your settings for next time.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Allows for fairly deep customization</p>
<p>Save your settings for easy use next time</p>
<p>Loads quickly and doesn’t use much CPU power</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Tricky to install correctly</p>
<p>Needs a better help section</p>
<p>Difficult to figure out what some functions do</p>

                ></p>
<p>The program is pretty advanced, but is more geared towards Skype, which is why it appears so low in this list. Getting your hands on the free version is pretty tricky, but you will find free options on the website. The interface is pretty intuitive to most tech-savvy people.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<p>The voice morphing tools are pretty advanced</p>
<p>Has various paid and free trial options for flexibility</p>
<p>You can customize the settings for a better output quality</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<p>The three paid versions are unfairly priced</p>
<p>Many functions on this tool will not be used by Discord users</p>
<p>Needs a strong tutorial section</p>

                ></p>
<p>This is a fine voice changer that changes your live voice and your recorded voice. The program is let down by how it uses its free services to push its paid in-app functions onto you. Be careful where you download this tool from because there are many websites offering this tool and some of them are offering a malicious download.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The parrot function repeats things back and is funny</p>
<p>Save and share your creations</p>
<p>Three different modes and 32 voice options</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface looks a little dated</p>
<p>It has in-app purchases that are unfair</p>
<p>The free voices available are very limited</p>

                ></p>
<p>This tool is actually rather good, but it is rather difficult to get it to work with discord. You need to make it so that the sound output is directed into Discord. Plus, it was custom-made for Smartphones and so looks clunky on desktops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Has a robust number of voices</p>
<p>Allows you to save your recordings</p>
<p>Pretty easy to understand how it works</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Slight lag when changing voices</p>
<p>Wants access to your external storage (your memory card)</p>
<p>Linking it up with Discord is tricky</p>

<p>Use this program online while you have Discord active. It probably wouldn’t be as low on this list if it didn’t make it clearer how to use this with Discord. In short, you have to use the microphone via this website and have the output directed into the Discord system.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Some of the voices sound very funny in a laugh-out-loud way</p>
<p>Many people agree it is a good voice changer for discord</p>
<p>Can use the voices for commercial use without attribution</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting it to work with Discord is overly difficult</p>
<p>Some of the voices make you impossible to understand</p>
<p>The WTF voice is mostly just your words being jumbled</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Choose-the-Right-Free-Voice-Changer-for-Discord-1"><a href="#How-to-Choose-the-Right-Free-Voice-Changer-for-Discord-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose the Right Free Voice Changer for Discord?"></a>How to Choose the Right Free Voice Changer for Discord?</h2><ol>
<li><strong>Simple or Professional</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The free voice changer you choose depends upon your needs. If you are looking for something simple and quick, then pick a free open-source program. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to help you record and change your voice, then consider a program that has added paid versions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What Operation System You Use? Windows, Mac, or More</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The voice changer for Discord Mac versions are a little less common on the Internet. If you are a Mac user, then consider sticking to the app offerings on Apple-moderated marketplaces. Changing your voice for Discord isn’t a difficult task, so you should probably stay clear from paid programs if you are a Mac user.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What Voice Effects Do You Want?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are looking for a female voice changer for Discord, then mostly every voice changer will suit you. Every app&#x2F;program listed on this article has a female voice version. The reason for this is because a female voice is often considered higher pitched and lighter, and such a tone is available through all the apps&#x2F;programs listed above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Is It Easy to Get the Tool to Work?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are having a hard time getting the voice changer to work with Discord, then take a look online and especially on YouTube. There are often users on YouTube who have had the same problem and who are showing off a new solution.</p>
<p>If you are really struggling to find a solution, then look for ways to get pre-recorded content into Discord. Usually, the people who offer solutions on Google and Bing to this problem will also have the solution to getting your funny voice changer to work with Discord.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Does it Have a Free Trial?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the primary reasons why shouldn’t pay for a voice changer, at least at first, is because there is no guarantee that program will work. It is better if you download and try a free version or use a free trial. That way, if it doesn’t work, you haven’t lost anything.</p>
<p>Do not be fooled into thinking you have to pay for each tool. Many voice changers will make it seem like their only options are paid versions, but this is often not the case. Even those that do not have a free version will often have a free trial that you can exploit.</p>

<p>The Clownfish voice changer for discord looks a little basic, but it is all worth it to keep things simple. It is not a sophisticated tool, but it does everything right. It would be nice if it had more voices or features but it is not a big problem.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is freeware and doesn’t require a free subscription or account sign-in</p>
<p>Works for all versions of windows</p>
<p>Setup is pretty easy and fast</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>There are no added voice effects except the custom pitch function</p>
<p>Some voices make certain accents difficult to understand</p>
<p>Has a limited girl voice changer for discord</p>

                ></p>
<p>With plenty of features, added effects and built in sounds, this voice changer for discord PC is one of the finest available. It may have made it to the top of this list if it didn’t restrict so many of its features to the paid version. The free version is good, but it pales in comparison to the paid process version.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Uses very little bandwidth and CPU power</p>
<p>Has sound effects you can throw into the mix</p>
<p>Custom shortcuts make using this tool easier</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Paid subscription version is very expensive</p>
<p>The interface shape looks weird and clunky</p>
<p>Slightly unintuitive install process</p>
<h4 id="3-VoiceMod-2"><a href="#3-VoiceMod-2" class="headerlink" title="3. VoiceMod"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.voicemod.net/voice-changer-demos/" >VoiceMod <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>The voice changing faculties work very well. If you are using this program to change your voice in real time, then it sounds good. If you are using it to change your recorded voice, then it sounds amazing. In fact, if this article were about finding a voice changer for recorded voices, rather than finding a free voice changer for discord live chat, then VoiceMod would win by a significant amount.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The voices you produce sound great</p>
<p>Professionally designed and easy to installs</p>
<p>Flexible with plenty of uses</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The free version locks off too many features</p>
<p>App and website needs proofreading for its many written mistakes</p>
<p>Seems to hide paid version until you have actually downloaded</p>

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>On the surface, the Voxal program is the best, but it has its annoying flaws. Installing cleanly is seemingly could be easier, and the program is not difficult to use. However, the free version is very limited. Many of the voices and many of the voice-manipulation tools are locked off from free users.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Has a low CPU usage</p>
<p>The interface is pretty easy to understand</p>
<p>Add effects to live and recorded voices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Compatibility with Steam games is hit and miss</p>
<p>Clean ad-free installs of the free version is tricky</p>
<p>Some voices sound too similar to bother with</p>

                ></p>
<p>This program has an easy-to-use system, and its interface would be lovely if not for a few poorly chosen fonts. The sad part is that this tool is tricky to find, especially if you want a non-Android version. This is because the tool doesn’t have its own website, so numerous websites seem to hold it, but they are not easy websites to find.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Connecting with Discord is very easy</p>
<p>Picking a voice is simple and fast</p>
<p>Very low CPU usage</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Difficult to install</p>
<p>Finding stable or reliable versions can be tricky</p>
<p>The developer Ovia Games is out of business</p>

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>This is a very lightweight tool, and it uses very little CPU power. But, that shouldn’t dissuade you from using it because it has three voices that you can warp and manipulate. The level at which you can manipulate them is very deep. Play with the settings until you find the voice you like, and then save your settings for next time.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Allows for fairly deep customization</p>
<p>Save your settings for easy use next time</p>
<p>Loads quickly and doesn’t use much CPU power</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Tricky to install correctly</p>
<p>Needs a better help section</p>
<p>Difficult to figure out what some functions do</p>

                ></p>
<p>The program is pretty advanced, but is more geared towards Skype, which is why it appears so low in this list. Getting your hands on the free version is pretty tricky, but you will find free options on the website. The interface is pretty intuitive to most tech-savvy people.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<p>The voice morphing tools are pretty advanced</p>
<p>Has various paid and free trial options for flexibility</p>
<p>You can customize the settings for a better output quality</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<p>The three paid versions are unfairly priced</p>
<p>Many functions on this tool will not be used by Discord users</p>
<p>Needs a strong tutorial section</p>

                ></p>
<p>This is a fine voice changer that changes your live voice and your recorded voice. The program is let down by how it uses its free services to push its paid in-app functions onto you. Be careful where you download this tool from because there are many websites offering this tool and some of them are offering a malicious download.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The parrot function repeats things back and is funny</p>
<p>Save and share your creations</p>
<p>Three different modes and 32 voice options</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface looks a little dated</p>
<p>It has in-app purchases that are unfair</p>
<p>The free voices available are very limited</p>

<p>This tool is actually rather good, but it is rather difficult to get it to work with discord. You need to make it so that the sound output is directed into Discord. Plus, it was custom-made for Smartphones and so looks clunky on desktops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Has a robust number of voices</p>
<p>Allows you to save your recordings</p>
<p>Pretty easy to understand how it works</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Slight lag when changing voices</p>
<p>Wants access to your external storage (your memory card)</p>
<p>Linking it up with Discord is tricky</p>

<p>Use this program online while you have Discord active. It probably wouldn’t be as low on this list if it didn’t make it clearer how to use this with Discord. In short, you have to use the microphone via this website and have the output directed into the Discord system.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Some of the voices sound very funny in a laugh-out-loud way</p>
<p>Many people agree it is a good voice changer for discord</p>
<p>Can use the voices for commercial use without attribution</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting it to work with Discord is overly difficult</p>
<p>Some of the voices make you impossible to understand</p>
<p>The WTF voice is mostly just your words being jumbled</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Choose-the-Right-Free-Voice-Changer-for-Discord-2"><a href="#How-to-Choose-the-Right-Free-Voice-Changer-for-Discord-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose the Right Free Voice Changer for Discord?"></a>How to Choose the Right Free Voice Changer for Discord?</h2><ol>
<li><strong>Simple or Professional</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The free voice changer you choose depends upon your needs. If you are looking for something simple and quick, then pick a free open-source program. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to help you record and change your voice, then consider a program that has added paid versions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What Operation System You Use? Windows, Mac, or More</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The voice changer for Discord Mac versions are a little less common on the Internet. If you are a Mac user, then consider sticking to the app offerings on Apple-moderated marketplaces. Changing your voice for Discord isn’t a difficult task, so you should probably stay clear from paid programs if you are a Mac user.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What Voice Effects Do You Want?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are looking for a female voice changer for Discord, then mostly every voice changer will suit you. Every app&#x2F;program listed on this article has a female voice version. The reason for this is because a female voice is often considered higher pitched and lighter, and such a tone is available through all the apps&#x2F;programs listed above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Is It Easy to Get the Tool to Work?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are having a hard time getting the voice changer to work with Discord, then take a look online and especially on YouTube. There are often users on YouTube who have had the same problem and who are showing off a new solution.</p>
<p>If you are really struggling to find a solution, then look for ways to get pre-recorded content into Discord. Usually, the people who offer solutions on Google and Bing to this problem will also have the solution to getting your funny voice changer to work with Discord.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Does it Have a Free Trial?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the primary reasons why shouldn’t pay for a voice changer, at least at first, is because there is no guarantee that program will work. It is better if you download and try a free version or use a free trial. That way, if it doesn’t work, you haven’t lost anything.</p>
<p>Do not be fooled into thinking you have to pay for each tool. Many voice changers will make it seem like their only options are paid versions, but this is often not the case. Even those that do not have a free version will often have a free trial that you can exploit.</p>

<p>You may also have a few problems in terms of compatibility. For example, some will only work on Windows devices, or iOS devices, or on Android devices. Though none of the programs listed in this article are iOS only.</p>

<p>The Clownfish voice changer for discord looks a little basic, but it is all worth it to keep things simple. It is not a sophisticated tool, but it does everything right. It would be nice if it had more voices or features but it is not a big problem.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is freeware and doesn’t require a free subscription or account sign-in</p>
<p>Works for all versions of windows</p>
<p>Setup is pretty easy and fast</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>There are no added voice effects except the custom pitch function</p>
<p>Some voices make certain accents difficult to understand</p>
<p>Has a limited girl voice changer for discord</p>

                ></p>
<p>With plenty of features, added effects and built in sounds, this voice changer for discord PC is one of the finest available. It may have made it to the top of this list if it didn’t restrict so many of its features to the paid version. The free version is good, but it pales in comparison to the paid process version.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Uses very little bandwidth and CPU power</p>
<p>Has sound effects you can throw into the mix</p>
<p>Custom shortcuts make using this tool easier</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Paid subscription version is very expensive</p>
<p>The interface shape looks weird and clunky</p>
<p>Slightly unintuitive install process</p>
<h4 id="3-VoiceMod-3"><a href="#3-VoiceMod-3" class="headerlink" title="3. VoiceMod"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.voicemod.net/voice-changer-demos/" >VoiceMod <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>The voice changing faculties work very well. If you are using this program to change your voice in real time, then it sounds good. If you are using it to change your recorded voice, then it sounds amazing. In fact, if this article were about finding a voice changer for recorded voices, rather than finding a free voice changer for discord live chat, then VoiceMod would win by a significant amount.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The voices you produce sound great</p>
<p>Professionally designed and easy to installs</p>
<p>Flexible with plenty of uses</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The free version locks off too many features</p>
<p>App and website needs proofreading for its many written mistakes</p>
<p>Seems to hide paid version until you have actually downloaded</p>

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>On the surface, the Voxal program is the best, but it has its annoying flaws. Installing cleanly is seemingly could be easier, and the program is not difficult to use. However, the free version is very limited. Many of the voices and many of the voice-manipulation tools are locked off from free users.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Has a low CPU usage</p>
<p>The interface is pretty easy to understand</p>
<p>Add effects to live and recorded voices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Compatibility with Steam games is hit and miss</p>
<p>Clean ad-free installs of the free version is tricky</p>
<p>Some voices sound too similar to bother with</p>

                ></p>
<p>This program has an easy-to-use system, and its interface would be lovely if not for a few poorly chosen fonts. The sad part is that this tool is tricky to find, especially if you want a non-Android version. This is because the tool doesn’t have its own website, so numerous websites seem to hold it, but they are not easy websites to find.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Connecting with Discord is very easy</p>
<p>Picking a voice is simple and fast</p>
<p>Very low CPU usage</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Difficult to install</p>
<p>Finding stable or reliable versions can be tricky</p>
<p>The developer Ovia Games is out of business</p>

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>This is a very lightweight tool, and it uses very little CPU power. But, that shouldn’t dissuade you from using it because it has three voices that you can warp and manipulate. The level at which you can manipulate them is very deep. Play with the settings until you find the voice you like, and then save your settings for next time.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Allows for fairly deep customization</p>
<p>Save your settings for easy use next time</p>
<p>Loads quickly and doesn’t use much CPU power</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Tricky to install correctly</p>
<p>Needs a better help section</p>
<p>Difficult to figure out what some functions do</p>

                ></p>
<p>The program is pretty advanced, but is more geared towards Skype, which is why it appears so low in this list. Getting your hands on the free version is pretty tricky, but you will find free options on the website. The interface is pretty intuitive to most tech-savvy people.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<p>The voice morphing tools are pretty advanced</p>
<p>Has various paid and free trial options for flexibility</p>
<p>You can customize the settings for a better output quality</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<p>The three paid versions are unfairly priced</p>
<p>Many functions on this tool will not be used by Discord users</p>
<p>Needs a strong tutorial section</p>

<p>This is a fine voice changer that changes your live voice and your recorded voice. The program is let down by how it uses its free services to push its paid in-app functions onto you. Be careful where you download this tool from because there are many websites offering this tool and some of them are offering a malicious download.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The parrot function repeats things back and is funny</p>
<p>Save and share your creations</p>
<p>Three different modes and 32 voice options</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface looks a little dated</p>
<p>It has in-app purchases that are unfair</p>
<p>The free voices available are very limited</p>

<p>This tool is actually rather good, but it is rather difficult to get it to work with discord. You need to make it so that the sound output is directed into Discord. Plus, it was custom-made for Smartphones and so looks clunky on desktops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Has a robust number of voices</p>
<p>Allows you to save your recordings</p>
<p>Pretty easy to understand how it works</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Slight lag when changing voices</p>
<p>Wants access to your external storage (your memory card)</p>
<p>Linking it up with Discord is tricky</p>

                      alt="free voice changer for discord"
                ></p>
<p>Use this program online while you have Discord active. It probably wouldn’t be as low on this list if it didn’t make it clearer how to use this with Discord. In short, you have to use the microphone via this website and have the output directed into the Discord system.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Some of the voices sound very funny in a laugh-out-loud way</p>
<p>Many people agree it is a good voice changer for discord</p>
<p>Can use the voices for commercial use without attribution</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting it to work with Discord is overly difficult</p>
<p>Some of the voices make you impossible to understand</p>
<p>The WTF voice is mostly just your words being jumbled</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Choose-the-Right-Free-Voice-Changer-for-Discord-3"><a href="#How-to-Choose-the-Right-Free-Voice-Changer-for-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose the Right Free Voice Changer for Discord?"></a>How to Choose the Right Free Voice Changer for Discord?</h2><ol>
<li><strong>Simple or Professional</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The free voice changer you choose depends upon your needs. If you are looking for something simple and quick, then pick a free open-source program. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to help you record and change your voice, then consider a program that has added paid versions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What Operation System You Use? Windows, Mac, or More</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The voice changer for Discord Mac versions are a little less common on the Internet. If you are a Mac user, then consider sticking to the app offerings on Apple-moderated marketplaces. Changing your voice for Discord isn’t a difficult task, so you should probably stay clear from paid programs if you are a Mac user.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What Voice Effects Do You Want?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are looking for a female voice changer for Discord, then mostly every voice changer will suit you. Every app&#x2F;program listed on this article has a female voice version. The reason for this is because a female voice is often considered higher pitched and lighter, and such a tone is available through all the apps&#x2F;programs listed above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Is It Easy to Get the Tool to Work?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are having a hard time getting the voice changer to work with Discord, then take a look online and especially on YouTube. There are often users on YouTube who have had the same problem and who are showing off a new solution.</p>
<p>If you are really struggling to find a solution, then look for ways to get pre-recorded content into Discord. Usually, the people who offer solutions on Google and Bing to this problem will also have the solution to getting your funny voice changer to work with Discord.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Does it Have a Free Trial?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the primary reasons why shouldn’t pay for a voice changer, at least at first, is because there is no guarantee that program will work. It is better if you download and try a free version or use a free trial. That way, if it doesn’t work, you haven’t lost anything.</p>
<p>Do not be fooled into thinking you have to pay for each tool. Many voice changers will make it seem like their only options are paid versions, but this is often not the case. Even those that do not have a free version will often have a free trial that you can exploit.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-Rating-the-Free-Voice-Changers-3"><a href="#Conclusion-Rating-the-Free-Voice-Changers-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion - Rating the Free Voice Changers"></a>Conclusion - Rating the Free Voice Changers</h2><p>Since each of the tools on this article are free, there is nothing stopping you from downloading all of them and trying each one. Just be sure you are downloading from a reliable and safe place because some websites host malicious downloads that are not what they say they are.</p>
<p>You may also have a few problems in terms of compatibility. For example, some will only work on Windows devices, or iOS devices, or on Android devices. Though none of the programs listed in this article are iOS only.</p>
