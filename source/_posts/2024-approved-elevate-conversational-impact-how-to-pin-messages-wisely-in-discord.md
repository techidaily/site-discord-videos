Like TeamSpeak or Skype, Discord is a chat app aimed at easy mass communication. Although it was made for gamers, it is readily used for communicating in offices, during projects, or for professional collaboration.

Even though it's straightforward to use, there are several Discord features that you may be unfamiliar with.

One such feature is called pinning messages. It is available to moderators, administrators, server owners, and other users who have permission to "Manage Messages" in various server channels.

This feature helps you find and share vital messages quickly, especially when new users join a specific channel.

It acts like a sticky note for Discord, making sure valuable information such as server rules do not get overshadowed by new messages even months after the pinned messages are first posted.

Today, we will go over how to pin a message on Discord for your desktop app on PC and Mac, as well as on your iPhone and Android mobile devices.

## Part 1: How to Pin A Message on Discord Desktop?

If you want to learn how to pin messages on Discord desktop, follow these steps:

1. Hover over any message which you wish to pin.
2. On the right-hand side of it, there will be a button that would read as More; click it and you will see a screen like below

![ Pin message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pin-messages-on-discord.jpg)

1. Now, click on the "Pin Message" option
2. After which, you will be presented with a prompt asking you to confirm that you want to pin this particular message. Click on "Oh yeah, pin it."

![ Pin message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/double-check-pin-messages.jpg)

That's it! You have now learned how to pin messages on Discord for the desktop application.

But make sure you don't pin everything that might seem important at a glance — only pin messages that may have utility in the future.

Also, don't pin messages that are just important for you. In larger channels, prioritize pinning messages that will benefit most participants.

## Part 2: How to Pin Messages on Discord Mobile App?

Pinning messages in the mobile app is very similar to how it is done on the desktop application. Do it by:

1. Just hold down your finger on the message you wish to pin
2. A couple of seconds later, you will be presented with a list of options
3. From here, click on "Pin Message"

![ Pin message on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pin-message-on-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. A pop-up will appear confirming if you want to pin the message. If you are sure you want to pin a particular message, tap the "Yes" button and then your message is pinned

## Part 3: How to View Pinned Messages on Discord

Accessing pinned messages is just as easy as pinning them. To access a pinned message on the app's desktop version:

1. Click on the pin icon appearing on the top right-hand side of your screen

![view Pinned message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-pinned-message.jpg)

1. Doing this will present you with a drop-down list of pinned messages. Now, you can tap on the "Jump" button next to the "x" (cross) icon to go directly to the pinned message
2. This will allow you to understand the context behind the pinned message. You can also access and share links in the pinned messages from here

## Part 4: How to View Pinned Messages on Discord Mobile

View your pins on the mobile version of Discord by:

1. Swiping from right to left, which will open up a side menu
2. Then click on "Pins," which is the second option from the left, as shown in the picture below

![view Pinned message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-pinned-message-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Now you will be in the pinned messages window
2. You can jump to a specific pinned message by clicking on it, allowing you to access any content or links in the message

## Part 5: Limit on Pinned Messages

You can only pin 50 messages in the pin box in Discord, meaning if you want to pin new messages, you will have to delete older ones to make space.

This may feel like a disadvantage. However, it makes perfect sense. Pinning messages is only for important information that must be used in the future.

Removing this limit and giving people free rein on the number of messages they can pin will eventually lead to too many pinned messages, defeating the feature's purpose.

## Part 6: How to Delete Pinned Messages on Discord?

If something pinned in the past has become redundant over time, you can remove it from the pinned messages.

This will make sure your pinned messages do not stockpile over time, and there is space to add new messages important to the server.

To remove pinned messages on desktops:

1. Go to the pin icon used to access pins
2. Next, hover over the message you wish to unpin and click on the "x" (cross) button next to the jump button
3. After this, click on the "yeah, remove it please kthx" button
4. The message will now stop appearing in the list of pinned messages

To do the same for mobile devices:

1. Swipe right to left to access the side menu
2. Click on "Pins" to view all the messages pinned by you or other people on the server with permissions to pin
3. Then hold down on the message, which will give you an option to unpin it
4. Click on "Unpin" to remove the message from the list of pinned messages

**Things to keep in mind**:

* You can skip the pop-up shown above when trying to remove a pinned message. All you must do is hold shift when clicking on the "x" (cross) button allowing you to go on that spree of unpins
* Another thing to remember is that all these tips on how pin messages apply to both Direct Messages (DM) and Server group chats

#### All in All

Learning how to pin a message on Discord could be a little tricky at first, mostly if you haven't done so in the past and someone spontaneously asks you to do so.

However, the feature is pretty intuitive and straightforward once you get the hang of it.

The usefulness of pinning makes it very important for both old and new users as you can relay important information without having to go through tons of old messages.

Many of you might be using various Discord Bots for server enhancement, like music bots, voice changers, etc., but not many people know about the **Discord** **plugins**. Discord plugins are add-ons for Discord that assist you in accessing extra features that are not available in the original Discord.

For beginners, these are something more than a regular bot.

Better Discord comes with support for using custom plugins and themes. In addition, we can download and install custom-made community plugins in a few clicks.

A plugin is simply an add-on that you can add to Discord to add additional features. For example, you may use various plugins like sending long messages, activating remote controls, showing Spotify controls, and more.

So, let’s dive into our top 10 **better discord plugins** in the following section without further ado!

* [Part 1: Top 10 Discord Plugins You Should Know](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Download and Apply Better Discord Plugins?](#part2)
* [Part 3: FAQs about Discord Plugins](#part3)

## **Part 1: Top 10 Discord Plugins You Should Know**

With the official server of Better Discord, you can install Discord Plugins and extend the features and functionalities offered on your Discord server.

Given below are some popular Discord plugins that are easily downloadable to improve the Discord server.

### 1. [Permissions Viewer](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/PermissionsViewer)

![discord plugin permissions viewer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-plugin-permissions-viewer.jpg)

Permission's Viewer is a useful Discord plugin for everyone. It will allow you to see all users' approval via a popup notification on a server. Additionally, it will disclose all the user permissions one has on the server.

Tapping the context menu will bring up the modal, which has a role-by-role breakdown. You can see all permissions, including managing channels, managing roles, and creating invites, etc.

### 2. [Hide Disabled Emojis](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/HideDisabledEmojis)

![hide disabled emojis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-plugin-hide-disabled-emojis.jpg)

Discord plugins consist of a perfect collection of different emojis from different sections. At the same time, it comes with some disabled emojis as well. Using this plugin, you can easily hide all the disabled emojis, not to make them visible again.

### 3. [Read All Notifications Button](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/ReadAllNotificationsButton)

![notifications discord plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/notifications-discord-plugin.jpg)

Read All Notifications Button is a handy Discord plugin to remove all notifications instantly. It’s a great way to de-clutter things if you are part of many servers.

Upon activating this plugin, a **Clear** button will show on your server list, and a mentions popout. Hitting the **Clear** tab from any of these two options will instantly clear every notification.

### 4. [Better Role Colors](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/BetterRoleColors)

![better role colors discord plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/better-role-colors-discord-plugin.jpg)

As the name signifies, this plugin will let you set the custom font colors for different server-based roles. The best part is you can set the custom colors for people based on their roles. So it's for sure that there will be multiple roles in a server.

The plugin includes colored voice, colored typing, color popouts and modals, and finally, a colored audit log.

### 5. [Creation Date](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/CreationDate)
