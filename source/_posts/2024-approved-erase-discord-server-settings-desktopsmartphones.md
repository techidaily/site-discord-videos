Discord servers are made and designed to help gamers – and now work colleagues – communicate and coordinate via private rooms.

However, you may have to someday delete a server you own.

Today we will discuss **how to delete Discord server** or deleting the Discord server of someone who has passed away:

## Part 1: How to Delete Discord Server Permanently on A Desktop?

If you're familiar with Discord, you will know that there will come a time that you no longer need a server: it may be because you've resigned from your workplace or stopped playing a game.

If you are looking into **how to delete your Discord server**, you came to the right place. Even though Discord makes communication easier, you may need a break from around-the-clock connectivity for various reasons.

Discord works on desktop platforms and smartphones, with a blend of a VoIP chat system, a chat lobby, and a message board in a single app. Therefore, you can attempt to delete a server off on any device that you may have Discord downloaded and active on.

Most server owners choose to delete their Discord server when too many extra, strange, or ill-meaning visitors are visiting.

Servers are more like chat rooms inside the application. Deleting them is a relatively simple process – as you will learn from our **how to delete server on Discord** tips – however, their retrieval is impossible.

Once the server has been removed, you can not "undo the process" or recreate it. Therefore, be absolutely sure and proceed with caution.

It is also advised to skim through any essential files that you might have on the server. Back them up before letting it go forever.

And lastly, ensure that this is what you intend on doing because deleting a Discord server is permanent. Here are the simple steps to follow on **how to delete a server on Discord**:

1. Open the Discord desktop app and click on the server you want to delete
2. Once you select the server, there will be an options list under the server's name
3. Click the "server setting" button from the menu (This will be the second option on the list)

**Step 2:** Once your profile is open, please click on the profile picture.

**Step 3:** On your profile, look at the bottom of the menu. You will see a pop-up menu that says set a custom status.

**Step 4:** On the emojis bar, you can add an emoji. To do that, you need to click on the emoji status. Next, you will see a list of emojis. Please note that only an active Nitro subscription user can use animated or custom emojis. On the left will be the category of emojis. Choose one category that suits your mood; once the category opens, click on an emoji to add it.

**Step 5:** After that, you need to click on the Today option. This will open a drop-down menu. You need to choose a time frame for the emoji or status. You can choose today, 4 hours, 1 hour, etc.

![add emoji to discord custom status](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-emoji-to-discord-custom-status.jpg)

If you are using the Discord app on your mobile phone, you can add a custom emoji on Discord status using your phone too. Follow the step-by-step guide that we have prepared to learn how to do that.

**Step 1:** Take your smartphone and look for the Discord app. The icon will look like a controller. Click on it to launch Discord.

**Step 2:** Just like the web steps, you will have to click on your profile. Click on the hamburger icon, which is there in the upper left corner. Then, look at the bottom right corner to find your profile.

**Step 3:** Now, click on the Set Status option. This will be the first option on your profile. Go on and click on that.

**Step 4:** After that, click on the option that says set a custom status. On the status bar, you will see an emoji. You need to click on that to open the list of emojis to choose from.

**Step 5:** Choose a time frame for the emoji, for example, 30 minutes, 1-hour, clear tomorrow, etc. If you are using an Android, you will see the floppy disk option; click on that to save your status. If you are using an iOS device, you will see the save option.

By following these steps, your status with the emoji you have chosen will be saved successfully. If you want to add a new emoji, repeat the same process.

## Part 3: How to Copy and Paste Emojis in Discord Status?

If you don’t want to go through the hassle of adding an emoji manually, you can just copy and paste one to your status. How to do it? Follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Go to a website that has emojis for Discord status.

**Step 2:** Scroll down the list of emojis and copy it.

**Step 3:** Go back to your Discord Nitro page and open the status setting. There, on the emoji section, paste the emoji that you have copied from another site.

Please note that this may not be possible for all types of emojis, though. Also, this will work if only the website has created emojis that can be directly copied and pasted on the status section.

## Part 4: How to Add Animated Emojis to Discord Status?

Apart from the basic emojis, you can also add animated emojis to your Discord Status to make your status look even better. Here are the steps to follow to add an animated emoji:

**Step 1:** First, go to a website called <https://betterdiscord.app/>. Once you are there, click on the Download option.

**Step 2:** You will see a page loaded with codes, right-click on the screen and click on the Save option. When it is downloaded, click on the Better Discord Windows installer. Next, read the license agreement and click on the Next option.

**Step 3:** Then click install better Discord and hit the next button. Choose the Discord version that you currently have installed.

**Step 4:** Open Discord and click on the user settings. There, you will see the Better Discord section. Next, click on the Plugin option. Now, close the Discord window and drag the animated status dot plugin into the plugin folder that opened after clicking on the Plugin option.

**Step 5:** Go to Discord again, and you will see the Animated Status option. Enable it and click on the gear icon. To add an animated emoji, click on the + icon. Next, you will see a Nitro ID field. Then, go to a chat page and click on the emoji option.

**Step 6:** Look at the emoji that you like and memorize the animated emoji name. Press \\ followed by the name of the emoji. Now, copy the whole text and paste it again. You will see a few numbers; that’s the Nitro ID for the emoji. Copy the number only, go back to the Animated plugin and paste it on the Nitro ID field. Go back to the Nitro page again, and you will see the animated emoji on your status.
