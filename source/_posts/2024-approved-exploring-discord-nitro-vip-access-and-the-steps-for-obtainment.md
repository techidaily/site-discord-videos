If you want to join an online community of like-minded folks, Discord is a perfect platform to do so. Introduced originally for gamers, it now has become a platform for all types of communities who want video calls, voice chats, video streaming, and more.

The premium subscription service for Discord is known as Discord Nitro! Want to learn more about it? Read on as we elaborate.

## Part 1: What Is Discord Nitro And What Does It Do?

Discord is absolutely free, but you may require a Discord Nitro subscription if you want to use its more powerful features! At this point, you may be wondering, what does Discord Nitro do?

Though upgrading is not a requirement as most features do not require a subscription, free users still have certain limitations.

![Discord Nitro pricing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-pricing.jpg)

For instance, they can’t use the same emojis on two servers. In addition to that, the streaming quality and account customization features also lack on the free plan. These features and more are strictly for Discord Nitro users only.

Apart from the fact that Discord Nitro offers better additional features, it also lets users help their preferred servers and unlock various features.

## Part 2: Why Should People Use The Discord Nitro?

With the discord free version, you can do many things: **communicate with your friend outside and inside of games, start your server, and even participate in various channels**.

For some, these features are more than adequate; for others, they aren’t! They want more capabilities, and Discord Nitro provides them exactly with that.

However, most of these new features are cosmetic.

For instance, **you can make and use your custom emojis if you’re an emoji admirer. Not only this, but you can also use animated emojis, including GIFs**.

![Discord Nitro benefits](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-benefits.jpg)

Without further ado, here are a few key benefits you’ll get with Discord Nitro:

### Better Emojis

We all know how vital emojis have become for healthy chitchats, even to the extent that no conversation seems complete if you don’t have an emoji in it.

**Discord Nitro allows you to collect and create your customized emojis**. Usually, these emojis are animated and easily used while chatting with other Discord users.

### Personal Profile

Since your personal profile is your only Discord identity, make sure to customize it with animated avatars and claim custom tags to get going.

### Better Animation

With Discord Nitro, you can also unblock various GIF avatars and custom tags.

### High-Definition (HD) Screen Sharing

You can share the game screen on the server or with friends and other users with Discord Nitro. Choose from 720p and 1080p at 30fps.

### Fancy Badge

One of the better additions for several Discord users is getting the latest, fancy badge. **With Discord Nitro, you can earn new badges to display on your personal profile**.

## Part 3: How Much Does Discord Nitro Cost?

Free Discord users can choose from two variants if they want to switch to Discord Nitro premium services.

You can choose between annual or monthly subscription plans. And if you pick a yearly subscription plan, you’ll get a 16% discount.

The two Discord Nitro variants are Nitro Classic and Nitro!

If you choose the Nitro classic subscription service, you’ll have to pay $4.99 on the monthly plan or $49.99 annually. This variant is comparatively cheaper than the Nitro and provides stripped-down features.

On the other hand, if you go for the Nitro subscription service, get ready to pay $99.99 on the yearly plan and $9.99 on the monthly. It offers many features to its users.

Both these variants provide loads of advantages to discord users; here are a handful of benefits the two paid subscription services offer:

* If you choose the free version, your screen share settings typically max out at the 720p resolution (30fps). However, if you select either of the two paid versions, you can share a screen with friends at 720p (60fps) resolution or 1080p resolution (30fps)
* Go-Live provides users with limited streaming; it means you can stream games to users who don’t happen to be your friends, unlike screen-share. So, with a free version, you can stream at 720p (30fps), whereas, Nitro Classic subscription will allow you to stream up to 1080p resolution (60fps), and the Nitro will provide you with 60fps and more quality
* With the free version, you can upload and share only 8MB size files. But with paid variants, you’ll get an increased uploading limit. For example, Nitro Classic allows an upload limit up to 50MB, while the Nitro goes a step further and allows 100MB
* Users of both paid versions will get a badge which will be displayed with their usernames
* You can upgrade your image to an animated GIF!
* With paid subscriptions, you can create customized usernames and emojis to enhance your experience

One significant difference between the Nitro and Nitro Classic versions is the difference between their server boost capability.

Server boost is a user-gifted advantage that paid subscribers can provide to server owners to unlock extra perks for other users. The Nitro service has two server boosts, unlike the Nitro Classic service.

If you want to join an online community of like-minded folks, Discord is a perfect platform to do so. Introduced originally for gamers, it now has become a platform for all types of communities who want video calls, voice chats, video streaming, and more.

It’s arguably one of the best and most popular apps among the global gaming community. Though it’s free to use, you need a paid subscription plan to unlock its full potential like almost all other online services available.

The premium subscription service for Discord is known as Discord Nitro! Want to learn more about it? Read on as we elaborate.

## Part 1: What Is Discord Nitro And What Does It Do?

Discord is absolutely free, but you may require a Discord Nitro subscription if you want to use its more powerful features! At this point, you may be wondering, what does Discord Nitro do?

Though upgrading is not a requirement as most features do not require a subscription, free users still have certain limitations.

![Discord Nitro pricing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-pricing.jpg)

For instance, they can’t use the same emojis on two servers. In addition to that, the streaming quality and account customization features also lack on the free plan. These features and more are strictly for Discord Nitro users only.

Apart from the fact that Discord Nitro offers better additional features, it also lets users help their preferred servers and unlock various features.

## Part 2: Why Should People Use The Discord Nitro?

With the discord free version, you can do many things: **communicate with your friend outside and inside of games, start your server, and even participate in various channels**.

For some, these features are more than adequate; for others, they aren’t! They want more capabilities, and Discord Nitro provides them exactly with that.

However, most of these new features are cosmetic.

For instance, **you can make and use your custom emojis if you’re an emoji admirer. Not only this, but you can also use animated emojis, including GIFs**.

![Discord Nitro benefits](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-benefits.jpg)

Without further ado, here are a few key benefits you’ll get with Discord Nitro:

### Better Emojis

We all know how vital emojis have become for healthy chitchats, even to the extent that no conversation seems complete if you don’t have an emoji in it.

**Discord Nitro allows you to collect and create your customized emojis**. Usually, these emojis are animated and easily used while chatting with other Discord users.

### Personal Profile

Since your personal profile is your only Discord identity, make sure to customize it with animated avatars and claim custom tags to get going.

### Better Animation

With Discord Nitro, you can also unblock various GIF avatars and custom tags.

### High-Definition (HD) Screen Sharing

You can share the game screen on the server or with friends and other users with Discord Nitro. Choose from 720p and 1080p at 30fps.

### Fancy Badge

One of the better additions for several Discord users is getting the latest, fancy badge. **With Discord Nitro, you can earn new badges to display on your personal profile**.

## Part 3: How Much Does Discord Nitro Cost?

Free Discord users can choose from two variants if they want to switch to Discord Nitro premium services.

You can choose between annual or monthly subscription plans. And if you pick a yearly subscription plan, you’ll get a 16% discount.

The two Discord Nitro variants are Nitro Classic and Nitro!

If you choose the Nitro classic subscription service, you’ll have to pay $4.99 on the monthly plan or $49.99 annually. This variant is comparatively cheaper than the Nitro and provides stripped-down features.

On the other hand, if you go for the Nitro subscription service, get ready to pay $99.99 on the yearly plan and $9.99 on the monthly. It offers many features to its users.

Both these variants provide loads of advantages to discord users; here are a handful of benefits the two paid subscription services offer:

* If you choose the free version, your screen share settings typically max out at the 720p resolution (30fps). However, if you select either of the two paid versions, you can share a screen with friends at 720p (60fps) resolution or 1080p resolution (30fps)
* Go-Live provides users with limited streaming; it means you can stream games to users who don’t happen to be your friends, unlike screen-share. So, with a free version, you can stream at 720p (30fps), whereas, Nitro Classic subscription will allow you to stream up to 1080p resolution (60fps), and the Nitro will provide you with 60fps and more quality
* With the free version, you can upload and share only 8MB size files. But with paid variants, you’ll get an increased uploading limit. For example, Nitro Classic allows an upload limit up to 50MB, while the Nitro goes a step further and allows 100MB
* Users of both paid versions will get a badge which will be displayed with their usernames
* You can upgrade your image to an animated GIF!
* With paid subscriptions, you can create customized usernames and emojis to enhance your experience

One significant difference between the Nitro and Nitro Classic versions is the difference between their server boost capability.

Server boost is a user-gifted advantage that paid subscribers can provide to server owners to unlock extra perks for other users. The Nitro service has two server boosts, unlike the Nitro Classic service.

## Part 4: How to Subscribe to Discord Nitro?

9. Discord will likely ban the dummy account you have created in the first place

**Note:** Make sure your primary account is safe. If you intend to repeat the process, make a new dummy account and Apple ID and use a different type of payment method.
