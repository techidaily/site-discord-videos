Discord is packed with great features, but one thing it’s missing is a screen recorder. You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.

Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.

One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.

* [Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?](#part4)

## Part 1: Best Windows/Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord

If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust [screen recording tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.

### 1. OBS

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.

There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.

### 2. Bandicam

Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.

Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn't involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95\. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.

### 3. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features [screen recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 4. DemoCreator

If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider [Wondershare DemoCreator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/). Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.

You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.

### 5. Camtasia

If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.

However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.

## Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord

If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.

### 2. Screen Capture

One such option is [Screen Capture](https://www.screencapture.com/), which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.

There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

### 3. Clipchamp

If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/). Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.

It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.

### 3. Screencast-o-matic

The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is [Screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder). This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.

The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.

## Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android

If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.

### 1. AZ Screen Recorder

[AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US) is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.

It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.

### 2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots

Another option for Android is [‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US). Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.

The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.

### 3. Record It

If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘[Record It!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545)’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.

The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.

## Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?

If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.

Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.

You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.

If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.

Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.

The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.

You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.

### 1. AZ Screen Recorder

[AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US) is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.

It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.

### 2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots

Another option for Android is [‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US). Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.

The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.

### 3. Record It

If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘[Record It!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545)’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.

The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.

## Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?

If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.

Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.

You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.

If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.

Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.

The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.

Discord is packed with great features, but one thing it’s missing is a screen recorder. You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.

Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.

One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.

* [Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord](#part2)
* [Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android](#part3)
* [Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?](#part4)

## Part 1: Best Windows/Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord

If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust [screen recording tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.

### 1. OBS

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.

There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.

### 2. Bandicam

Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.

Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn't involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95\. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.

### 3. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features [screen recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 4. DemoCreator

If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider [Wondershare DemoCreator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/). Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.

You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.

### 5. Camtasia

If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.

However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.

## Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord

If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.

### 2. Screen Capture

One such option is [Screen Capture](https://www.screencapture.com/), which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.

There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

### 3. Clipchamp

If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/). Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.

It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.

### 3. Screencast-o-matic

The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is [Screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder). This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.

The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.

## Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android

If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated.

If you want to join an online community of like-minded folks, Discord is a perfect platform to do so. Introduced originally for gamers, it now has become a platform for all types of communities who want video calls, voice chats, video streaming, and more.

It’s arguably one of the best and most popular apps among the global gaming community. Though it’s free to use, you need a paid subscription plan to unlock its full potential like almost all other online services available.

The premium subscription service for Discord is known as Discord Nitro! Want to learn more about it? Read on as we elaborate.

## Part 1: What Is Discord Nitro And What Does It Do?

Discord is absolutely free, but you may require a Discord Nitro subscription if you want to use its more powerful features! At this point, you may be wondering, what does Discord Nitro do?

Though upgrading is not a requirement as most features do not require a subscription, free users still have certain limitations.

![ Discord Nitro pricing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-pricing.jpg)

For instance, they can’t use the same emojis on two servers. In addition to that, the streaming quality and account customization features also lack on the free plan. These features and more are strictly for Discord Nitro users only.

Apart from the fact that Discord Nitro offers better additional features, it also lets users help their preferred servers and unlock various features.

## Part 2: Why Should People Use The Discord Nitro?

With the discord free version, you can do many things: **communicate with your friend outside and inside of games, start your server, and even participate in various channels**.

For some, these features are more than adequate; for others, they aren’t! They want more capabilities, and Discord Nitro provides them exactly with that.

However, most of these new features are cosmetic.

For instance, **you can make and use your custom emojis if you’re an emoji admirer. Not only this, but you can also use animated emojis, including GIFs**.

![ Discord Nitro benefits](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-benefits.jpg)

Without further ado, here are a few key benefits you’ll get with Discord Nitro:

### Better Emojis

We all know how vital emojis have become for healthy chitchats, even to the extent that no conversation seems complete if you don’t have an emoji in it.

**Discord Nitro allows you to collect and create your customized emojis**. Usually, these emojis are animated and easily used while chatting with other Discord users.

### Personal Profile

Since your personal profile is your only Discord identity, make sure to customize it with animated avatars and claim custom tags to get going.

### Better Animation

With Discord Nitro, you can also unblock various GIF avatars and custom tags.

### High-Definition (HD) Screen Sharing

You can share the game screen on the server or with friends and other users with Discord Nitro. Choose from 720p and 1080p at 30fps.

### Fancy Badge

One of the better additions for several Discord users is getting the latest, fancy badge. **With Discord Nitro, you can earn new badges to display on your personal profile**.

## Part 3: How Much Does Discord Nitro Cost?

Free Discord users can choose from two variants if they want to switch to Discord Nitro premium services.

You can choose between annual or monthly subscription plans. And if you pick a yearly subscription plan, you’ll get a 16% discount.

The two Discord Nitro variants are Nitro Classic and Nitro!

If you choose the Nitro classic subscription service, you’ll have to pay $4.99 on the monthly plan or $49.99 annually. This variant is comparatively cheaper than the Nitro and provides stripped-down features.

On the other hand, if you go for the Nitro subscription service, get ready to pay $99.99 on the yearly plan and $9.99 on the monthly. It offers many features to its users.

Both these variants provide loads of advantages to discord users; here are a handful of benefits the two paid subscription services offer:

* If you choose the free version, your screen share settings typically max out at the 720p resolution (30fps). However, if you select either of the two paid versions, you can share a screen with friends at 720p (60fps) resolution or 1080p resolution (30fps)
* Go-Live provides users with limited streaming; it means you can stream games to users who don’t happen to be your friends, unlike screen-share. So, with a free version, you can stream at 720p (30fps), whereas, Nitro Classic subscription will allow you to stream up to 1080p resolution (60fps), and the Nitro will provide you with 60fps and more quality
* With the free version, you can upload and share only 8MB size files. But with paid variants, you’ll get an increased uploading limit. For example, Nitro Classic allows an upload limit up to 50MB, while the Nitro goes a step further and allows 100MB
* Users of both paid versions will get a badge which will be displayed with their usernames
* You can upgrade your image to an animated GIF!
* With paid subscriptions, you can create customized usernames and emojis to enhance your experience

One significant difference between the Nitro and Nitro Classic versions is the difference between their server boost capability.

Server boost is a user-gifted advantage that paid subscribers can provide to server owners to unlock extra perks for other users. The Nitro service has two server boosts, unlike the Nitro Classic service.

## Part 4: How to Subscribe to Discord Nitro?

Looking at the perks you get if you become a paid Discord member, it’s evident that several users will want to avail the opportunity. Especially with the number of streamers and gamers increasing every day!

But how does one upgrade to Discord Nitro?

It’s quite straightforward to get a paid subscription plan with Discord. You can either do it using the mobile app or through your desktop.

### Subscribing On MAC Or PC

To get a subscription plan through a desktop app or Discord website, follow the steps below:

1. Click the ‘settings’ icon at the bottom of your screen
2. Once your settings menu appear, click Discord Nitro
3. Press the subscribe button below Discord Nitro to subscribe to either of the two variants you choose
4. If you want to gift a paid subscription plan to some other user on Discord, click gift next to the ‘subscribe’ button

![Subscribe to Discord Nitro  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subscribe-to-discord-nitro.jpg)

### Subscribing Via Mobile Apps

If you want to subscribe through a mobile app, you can tap the hamburger menu on the top-left.

As the menu appears, tap the user icon and then tap Subscribe Today from the various options listed below the settings category.

![Subscribe to Discord Nitro  on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subscribe-to-discord-mobile.jpg)

You’ll see brief info on the subscription-plan. Once you read it, tap subscribe button below Discord Nitro Classic or Discord Nitro.

Follow the directions to confirm the payment. The moment it gets approved, your subscription is activated.

## Part 5: How to Get Discord Nitro for Free?

If you want to get Discord Nitro for free, you can get it without paying a dime. There are various methods you can follow to get a free subscription plan.

Today, we will tell you two effective ways through which you’ll get your free Discord Nitro subscription plan.

### First Method

Here’s how to get free Nitro with your Xbox game-pass:

As the menu appears, tap the user icon and then tap Subscribe Today from the various options listed below the settings category.

1. Download, install, and run your Xbox app for Windows
2. Log in to your account; if you don’t have one, create your account using outlook email. After that, place a gamer tag, press Game Pass and then press Get a Game Pass
3. Press Join Game Pass and make sure to join through “Xbox game pass ultimate” to qualify for a free subscription plan
4. Buy a game pass that will cost you only a dollar to get a free Discord Nitro
5. Click the perks button on your Game Pass window tab and scroll down and click the Get Link button
6. As the link opens, subscribe for the three-month plan of Nitro
7. Now visit Microsoft services to claim it
8. Log in to the account through which you bought “game pass ultimate” and cancel the subscription

This way, you can Discord Nitro free of cost!

### Second Method

Here’s how you can get free Discord Nitro through your mobile app:

1. Create a Discord account using a mobile app
2. Join some, if not many, public servers
3. Now add some people
4. Buy a Discord “Nitro Gift” for one month using your dummy account (make sure to purchase the gift through Apple)
5. Then, send the Nitro Gift back to your primary account
6. Redeem the gift on the primary account and wait at least a day or two
7. Now, contact Apple and say you have no idea what this ten-dollar charge is on the Discord. Make them believe your little brother or kid has been purchasing things using your cell phone
8. Apple Inc. will repay you the entire $10 you spent on buying
9. Discord will likely ban the dummy account you have created in the first place

**Note:** Make sure your primary account is safe. If you intend to repeat the process, make a new dummy account and Apple ID and use a different type of payment method.

## Part 6: When Should I Use Discord Nitro?

Discord Nitro improves your all in one Discord video, voice, and chats. Here’s when you should use Discord Nitro subscription plans, be it Nitro Classic or Nitro:

* Use the Discord Nitro if you want better, customized, and animated emojis in your chats to make the conversation more lively
* Go for the paid plan if you want a personalized profile with custom tags and an animated avatar
* Use discord Nitro if you want an extra 30% boost and two server boosts
* Lastly, if you want bigger uploads and high-definition videos, you should use Discord Nitro!

So, with a free version, you can stream at 720p (30fps), whereas, Nitro Classic subscription will allow you to stream up to 1080p resolution (60fps), and the Nitro will provide you with 60fps and more quality
* With the free version, you can upload and share only 8MB size files. But with paid variants, you’ll get an increased uploading limit. For example, Nitro Classic allows an upload limit up to 50MB, while the Nitro goes a step further and allows 100MB
* Users of both paid versions will get a badge which will be displayed with their usernames
* You can upgrade your image to an animated GIF!
* With paid subscriptions, you can create customized usernames and emojis to enhance your experience

One significant difference between the Nitro and Nitro Classic versions is the difference between their server boost capability.

Server boost is a user-gifted advantage that paid subscribers can provide to server owners to unlock extra perks for other users. The Nitro service has two server boosts, unlike the Nitro Classic service.

## Part 1: What Is Discord Nitro And What Does It Do?

Discord is absolutely free, but you may require a Discord Nitro subscription if you want to use its more powerful features! At this point, you may be wondering, what does Discord Nitro do?

Though upgrading is not a requirement as most features do not require a subscription, free users still have certain limitations.

![ Discord Nitro pricing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-pricing.jpg)

For instance, they can’t use the same emojis on two servers. In addition to that, the streaming quality and account customization features also lack on the free plan. These features and more are strictly for Discord Nitro users only.

Apart from the fact that Discord Nitro offers better additional features, it also lets users help their preferred servers and unlock various features.

## Part 2: Why Should People Use The Discord Nitro?

With the discord free version, you can do many things: **communicate with your friend outside and inside of games, start your server, and even participate in various channels**.

For some, these features are more than adequate; for others, they aren’t! They want more capabilities, and Discord Nitro provides them exactly with that.

However, most of these new features are cosmetic.

For instance, **you can make and use your custom emojis if you’re an emoji admirer. Not only this, but you can also use animated emojis, including GIFs**.

![ Discord Nitro benefits](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-benefits.jpg)

Without further ado, here are a few key benefits you’ll get with Discord Nitro:

### Better Emojis

We all know how vital emojis have become for healthy chitchats, even to the extent that no conversation seems complete if you don’t have an emoji in it.

**Discord Nitro allows you to collect and create your customized emojis**. Usually, these emojis are animated and easily used while chatting with other Discord users.

### Personal Profile

Since your personal profile is your only Discord identity, make sure to customize it with animated avatars and claim custom tags to get going.

### Better Animation

With Discord Nitro, you can also unblock various GIF avatars and custom tags.

### High-Definition (HD) Screen Sharing

You can share the game screen on the server or with friends and other users with Discord Nitro. Choose from 720p and 1080p at 30fps.

### Fancy Badge

One of the better additions for several Discord users is getting the latest, fancy badge. **With Discord Nitro, you can earn new badges to display on your personal profile**.

## Part 3: How Much Does Discord Nitro Cost?

Free Discord users can choose from two variants if they want to switch to Discord Nitro premium services.

You can choose between annual or monthly subscription plans. And if you pick a yearly subscription plan, you’ll get a 16% discount.

The two Discord Nitro variants are Nitro Classic and Nitro!

If you choose the Nitro classic subscription service, you’ll have to pay $4.99 on the monthly plan or $49.99 annually. This variant is comparatively cheaper than the Nitro and provides stripped-down features.

On the other hand, if you go for the Nitro subscription service, get ready to pay $99.99 on the yearly plan and $9.99 on the monthly. It offers many features to its users.

Both these variants provide loads of advantages to discord users; here are a handful of benefits the two paid subscription services offer:

* If you choose the free version, your screen share settings typically max out at the 720p resolution (30fps). However, if you select either of the two paid versions, you can share a screen with friends at 720p (60fps) resolution or 1080p resolution (30fps)
* Go-Live provides users with limited streaming; it means you can stream games to users who don’t happen to be your friends, unlike screen-share.
