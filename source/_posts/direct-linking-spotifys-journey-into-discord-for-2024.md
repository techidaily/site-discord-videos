### FAQs About Connecting Spotify to Discord

#### 1\. Why Can’t I See Playing Spotify Music on Discord Mobile?

When you’ve Spotify on your mobile app, you won’t see what songs you’re playing and listening to, despite the fact it’s connected.

The feature is only for premium/free accounts and works for windows Mac/PC; however, it won’t work on mobile as it has a different API.

#### 2\. Can I Disconnect Spotify From Discord?

1. Click the Connections option at the left side of your desktop app;
2. Click Spotify and then click X at the top-left of the green box;
3. Click disconnect and the connection between Spotify and Discord is disconnected.
