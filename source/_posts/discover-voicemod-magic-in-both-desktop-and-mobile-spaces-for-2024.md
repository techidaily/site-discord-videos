## Part 1: How To Use Voice Changer Voicemod For Discord On Desktop Computer

Voicemod is arguably one of the best voice changer tools available on the internet for its excellent features.

But before we jump straight into using Voicemod for Discord, you must know how to install one on your desktop Mac/PC.

### Here's how to install Voicemod

1. Visit the Voicemod website to begin the download process.
2. You'll see the button “Get Voicemod Free” on the screen. Click it!
3. Upon clicking, the site will ask you to sign in to your account from Discord, Twitch, to Google. Use your Discord login details to sign in.
4. After you're signed in, the “.exe” file will be downloaded to your PC/Mac's download folder. Open the “.exe” file the moment it's downloaded.
5. An install wizard will open up. Navigate through the wizard's installation process to install the program on your PC/Mac.
6. After installation is complete, the installation wizard will ask to restart your windows' Mac or PC.

You can skip it, but it's best to restart it for smooth operations.

Once your Mac/PC restarts, you'll see the Voicemod app icon on your desktop screen.

Now that you have successfully installed the voice changer Voicemod app into your desktop computer, let's dive into knowing **how to use Voicemod on Discord**!

### Here's how to use voice changer on Discord

1. Click the Vociemod icon on the desktop to open the app. If you can't find it there, click the “windows icon” located at the screen's bottom-left. Just type “Voicemod,” and the program will show up. Double click it to get it opened.
2. When the app opens up, you'll have to choose the output and input it will use. If you're wondering, why the output? This is to give you an insight into what your voice will sound like on each filter.

Once it's done, you can play around with different filters!

Every day, you'll get new free filters to use; however, to unlock and access all filters, you need to upgrade to the “pro-version” of voice changer Voicemod.

On the other hand, if you only need a few filters, the “basic-version” should suffice.

Apart from that, you can unlock an additional free filter in your app by sharing it on your social media accounts.

![Set up Voicemod for Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-voicemod-discord.jpg)

#### Step 1

To set up Voicemod with Discord, open your discord account and go to the settings (gear icon) placed at the screen's bottom-left corner.

#### Step 2

Click the “Voice and Video” option right under the app settings.

#### Step 3

To make Voicemod usable, you'll have to change Voice settings. Within the “Input Device” option, select the option that says “Microphone Voicemod Virtual Audio.”

#### Step 4

After you have changed settings, you can easily change the voice within the program. Not only this, but other users can also hear your audio alteration.

#### Step 5

With the “basic version,” you'll have seven free voice choices that will change each day. On the contrary, with the “pro-version,” you'll gain access to more than 80 different voice options.

So, if you're searching for an easy and simple voice-changing app to use, look no further than Voicemod!

## Part 2: How To Fix Voicemod Not Working Discord?

Is your voice changer Voicemod not working on Discord? No worries, you can troubleshoot the issues with a few basic steps.

Here are some ways you can use to fix Voicemod not working in Discord:

### Method 1: Restart Your Windows PC/Mac

Though it's not a technical solution, restarting your desktop computer fixes incorrect settings by rebooting them and solves many problems connected with your computer system, programs, and hardware.

So, when your Voicemod suddenly ceases to work in Discord, make sure to restart your Windows PC/Mac before going any further, as it's the first step in fixing voice issues.

If restarting doesn't help, slide to the next step!

### Method 2: Make Sure The Mic Is Properly Set

Just follow the steps below to resolve it:

1. On the keyboard, press the “Win” logo and the “I” key simultaneously to open Windows settings. Click “System.”
2. On the left, you'll see the option “Sound.” Click it.

2. Click “Device properties & test microphone”
3. Make sure to uncheck the “disable” box and keep the volume section 100
4. Click the “Start test” button and speak into the microphone
5. After that, click “Stop test.” If the greatest value it shows is above “0”, then your microphone works correctly

Now, restart your Voicemod app to see if it's working properly or not! If the issue still persists, jump to the next solution.

### Method 4:Re-Install Voice Changer Voicemod Drivers

Voicemod is arguably one of the best voice changer tools available on the internet for its excellent features.

But before we jump straight into using Voicemod for Discord, you must know how to install one on your desktop Mac/PC.

### Here's how to install Voicemod

1. Visit the Voicemod website to begin the download process.
2. You'll see the button “Get Voicemod Free” on the screen. Click it!
3. Upon clicking, the site will ask you to sign in to your account from Discord, Twitch, to Google. Use your Discord login details to sign in.
4. After you're signed in, the “.exe” file will be downloaded to your PC/Mac's download folder. Open the “.exe” file the moment it's downloaded.
5. An install wizard will open up. Navigate through the wizard's installation process to install the program on your PC/Mac.
6. After installation is complete, the installation wizard will ask to restart your windows' Mac or PC.

You can skip it, but it's best to restart it for smooth operations.

Once your Mac/PC restarts, you'll see the Voicemod app icon on your desktop screen.

Now that you have successfully installed the voice changer Voicemod app into your desktop computer, let's dive into knowing **how to use Voicemod on Discord**!

### Here's how to use voice changer on Discord

1. Click the Vociemod icon on the desktop to open the app. If you can't find it there, click the “windows icon” located at the screen's bottom-left. Just type “Voicemod,” and the program will show up. Double click it to get it opened.
2. When the app opens up, you'll have to choose the output and input it will use. If you're wondering, why the output? This is to give you an insight into what your voice will sound like on each filter.

Once it's done, you can play around with different filters!

Every day, you'll get new free filters to use; however, to unlock and access all filters, you need to upgrade to the “pro-version” of voice changer Voicemod.

On the other hand, if you only need a few filters, the “basic-version” should suffice.

Apart from that, you can unlock an additional free filter in your app by sharing it on your social media accounts.

#### Step 2

Click the “Voice and Video” option right under the app settings.

#### Step 3

To make Voicemod usable, you'll have to change Voice settings. Within the “Input Device” option, select the option that says “Microphone Voicemod Virtual Audio.”

After you have changed settings, you can easily change the voice within the program. Not only this, but other users can also hear your audio alteration.

#### Step 5

With the “basic version,” you'll have seven free voice choices that will change each day. On the contrary, with the “pro-version,” you'll gain access to more than 80 different voice options.

3. Make sure to uncheck the “disable” box and keep the volume section 100
4. Click the “Start test” button and speak into the microphone

### Method 3: Install Windows Updates

If you use Windows 10, it has two kinds of updates that offer performance boost and security patches. Sometimes, an update can fix a few driver and software conflicts automatically.

1. Open your windows setting by pressing the “Windows button” and the “I” key together.
2. Click on “Update and Security”

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Since the pandemic, communication-based social media websites have become even more popular; be it Instagram, Twitter, or Discord; they have amassed millions of users.

Some of these users are credible organizations, companies, celebrities, or other revered personalities. And they are usually given verified accounts. The mark of a verified account is the tiny blue tick next to the name.

People strive for this blue tick because it makes their account seem “official”; other users don’t mind sharing from and sharing with these accounts.

Once users know that a specific social media account is a verified one, they would never hesitate to interact with them.

If you want that kind of reverence for your online presence, keep reading as we elaborate on **how to get verified on Discord**:

#### In this article

* [Part 1: How to Get Verified On Discord](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Apply For Discord Partnership](#part2)
* [Part 3: Differences Between Discord Verification And Partnership](#part3)

## Part 1: How to Get Verified On Discord

Verification on social media sites is most often used as proving your identity when you are a semi-famous or famous individual.

However, unlike the variety of other social media platforms, Discord does not verify just about anyone with a large following.

Presently, verification on Discord is limited to publishers and game developers, Spotify verified musical artists, and professional e-sports teams with massive followers and monthly listeners.

Suppose you are a content creator on YouTube, Twitch, or Reddit. In that case, you can also apply for Discord Partnership, which is an alternative account identification form.

Therefore, read on as we discuss **how to get verified on Discord**:

### Requirements Of Getting Verified On Discord

If you want to get verified on Discord, here are all the things you need to know about the application and qualification process:

* You must be a server owner and be the official representative of a group, team, or individual applying
* The server being verified must also meet the [community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) of Discord
* If you do not fall into any of the categories mentioned above, you cannot be verified on Discord
* However, if you do meet the criteria, you would have to go to [discordapp.com/verification](https://discord.com/verification) and click on “Apply Now”
* Applicants are also required to provide an associated email address, along with the supplementary information proving their identity

Suppose you do not fit into the Discord verification criteria, but you are a streamer or a content creator. In that case, you can apply for your server to become a Discord Partner.

## Part 2: How to Apply For Discord Partnership

Recently there was a change in the Discord Partner Program, rewarding more active servers instead of the server owners with a large following outside of Discord.

For eligibility in the Discord Partner Program, the server in question must meet the Activity Requirements that are listed in the Partner Program portion of Server Insights.

You must keep in mind that partnership is not automatic, and you must fill out an application. Discord can also remove your partnership at any time if the requirements mentioned above are not met for a prolonged period.

### Requirements For Partner Discord Servers

The Discord partner program provides engaged and well-moderated servers with the extra tools and recognition to re-invest in the community. The accepted servers also get additional benefits and perks.

![Get Certified on Discord - Enable Discord Community Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-discord-community-interface.jpg)

Before submitting your Partner application, you would need to check the server engagement requirements.

The servers thinking of applying to the Partner program have to be marked as “Community” servers in the Server Settings, allowing access to Server Insights.

![How to Get Certified on Discord - Discord Partner Program](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-partner-program.jpg)

The Server Insights will help you look at how close you are to applying to the Discord Partner Program.

You can also track the progress towards unlocking your Partner Program application anytime inside the Server Insights and the in-app Partner page.

Once you attain access to this page, there are specific server requirements that you would have to reach:

* The server must be a minimum of eight weeks old
* You must have a minimum of 500 members on your server
* Have a minimum of fifty communicators, people actively talking on your server per week
* Have a minimum of a hundred participators, people visiting/viewing your server per week
* Have a minimum of 20% Week 1 retention over a period of 8 weeks
* You must have enabled the two-factor authentication requirement for Server Moderation. This can be found in the Server Settings and then going to Moderation

Once you are a Discord Partner, you will get access to the VIP features mentioned below:

* You will receive a banner for your server
* You will receive an animated server icon
* The server and the server owner will receive a Discord Partner badge
* The server owner will receive a subscription to Discord Nitro throughout the partnership
* The partnered server also receives a customizable vanity invite URL

## Part 3: Differences Between Discord Verification And Partnership

**Discord verification** goes to servers that are run by brands, figures of public interest, and businesses. A verified badge shows the official home of that community.

Acceptance into the **Discord Verification** program only gives you server access to the Vanity URL, Verified Server badge, and the invite splash background.

In contrast, the Partner program provides a server banner, animated server icon, Nitro subscription, and a Discord Partner badge.

Furthermore, the Discord Partner Program aims to reward engaged, quality servers by providing them with extra tools and recognition, helping them invest further into their community.

A partner badge next to a server’s name indicates that it is one of the most engaging and reliable communities on Discord.

You might be thinking, can I be Discord Verified and Discord Partner at the same time? The answer is yes, you can.

If you are qualified for both programs, you can be in them. A Discord Verified server could send its application to the Discord Partner Program when they satisfy Partner Program requirements.

Lastly, if a server is removed from one of the programs, it can still be in the other one. Like, suppose a server is both Verified and Partnered but loses its Partnership. In that case, it can still stay verified and enjoy all the added benefits of **Discord Verification**.

## Frequently Asked Question about Getting Verification on Discord

#### Question 1: How long will it take to complete verification on Discord?

Answer: Generally, it would take around 5 business day to complete the verfication. However, the time may varies depend on the amount of application.

_Soure: Discord Support_

#### Question 2: Will I get charged for getting my server verified?

Answer: No. You won't be charged for getting your Discord server verified.

#### Question: Can I apply verification if our server is run by fan?

Answer: No, fan server can not be verified.

Before submitting your Partner application, you would need to check the server engagement requirements.

The servers thinking of applying to the Partner program have to be marked as “Community” servers in the Server Settings, allowing access to Server Insights.

The Server Insights will help you look at how close you are to applying to the Discord Partner Program.

You can also track the progress towards unlocking your Partner Program application anytime inside the Server Insights and the in-app Partner page.

Once you attain access to this page, there are specific server requirements that you would have to reach:

* The server must be a minimum of eight weeks old
* You must have a minimum of 500 members on your server
* Have a minimum of fifty communicators, people actively talking on your server per week
* Have a minimum of a hundred participators, people visiting/viewing your server per week
* Have a minimum of 20% Week 1 retention over a period of 8 weeks
* You must have enabled the two-factor authentication requirement for Server Moderation. This can be found in the Server Settings and then going to Moderation

Once you are a Discord Partner, you will get access to the VIP features mentioned below:

* You will receive a banner for your server
* You will receive an animated server icon
* The server and the server owner will receive a Discord Partner badge
* The server owner will receive a subscription to Discord Nitro throughout the partnership
* The partnered server also receives a customizable vanity invite URL

## Part 3: Differences Between Discord Verification And Partnership

**Discord verification** goes to servers that are run by brands, figures of public interest, and businesses. A verified badge shows the official home of that community.

Acceptance into the **Discord Verification** program only gives you server access to the Vanity URL, Verified Server badge, and the invite splash background.

In contrast, the Partner program provides a server banner, animated server icon, Nitro subscription, and a Discord Partner badge.

Furthermore, the Discord Partner Program aims to reward engaged, quality servers by providing them with extra tools and recognition, helping them invest further into their community.

A partner badge next to a server’s name indicates that it is one of the most engaging and reliable communities on Discord.

You might be thinking, can I be Discord Verified and Discord Partner at the same time? The answer is yes, you can.

If you are qualified for both programs, you can be in them. A Discord Verified server could send its application to the Discord Partner Program when they satisfy Partner Program requirements.

Lastly, if a server is removed from one of the programs, it can still be in the other one. Like, suppose a server is both Verified and Partnered but loses its Partnership. In that case, it can still stay verified and enjoy all the added benefits of **Discord Verification**.

## Frequently Asked Question about Getting Verification on Discord

#### Question 1: How long will it take to complete verification on Discord?

Answer: Generally, it would take around 5 business day to complete the verfication. However, the time may varies depend on the amount of application.

_Soure: Discord Support_

#### Question 2: Will I get charged for getting my server verified?

Answer: No. You won't be charged for getting your Discord server verified.

#### Question: Can I apply verification if our server is run by fan?

Answer: No, fan server can not be verified.
