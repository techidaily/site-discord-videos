### 03Evoke emotions

We might forget somebody’s name but we won’t forget how they made us feel. The same thing applies when designing your animated logo. Create emotions in your audience which will make them remember your brand for longer. Choose an emotion or a value that characterizes your brand and convey that spirit through your animation. Keep them connected throughout and make sure there is no point where they get zoned out.

### 04Create a dynamic logo animation

Remember that if you generate a dynamic complete brand animation, you may be able to draw vital attention from your potential customers from the very initial frame of your promoting video. A dynamic animation logo design plays an important role in making a novel interest to the sense of your target audience. Try and animate every sign, icon, and letter, that are the intrinsic part of a whole logo. Also have clarity on which animation style you want. It can be natural or wild, simple or modern anything of your choice. Avoid mixing multiple themes which might create a sense of confusion to the audience. Just remember that your animated logo should make an impact!

### 05Keep it short and simple

Modern animations are simple, short but effective. Dragging it longer will just bore your audience and they might lose interest in your animated logo and your brand. When your animated logo is short and simple it will stay memorable. It is recommended to never let your animations last more than 3-4 seconds. You can of course have the logo stay on screen longer. Every millisecond in the video should be engaging and how you do that is left to your creativity. You can keep it professional or fun-filled! Be creative and make sure to think out of the box. Remember your competitors will also be thinking of animated logos, so how will you grab the attention of users is very important. Remember less is more!
