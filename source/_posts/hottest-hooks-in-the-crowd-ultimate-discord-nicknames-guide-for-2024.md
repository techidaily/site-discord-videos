First, let's understand discord before you look for funny or cool **discord names**.

Regarding the origin, Discord allows you and different individuals to text each other. Here, almost every group is named a "server." All in all, it's more of a standard version of Slack for ease of understanding.

Servers packed with different text channels and voice channels are places where you can interact with each other. Moreover, it also assists users to share recordings, web connections, pictures, music, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. Thus, having good Discord names is more of a necessity than a luxury!

In this guide, you will gather all the cool and funny Discord names collected and crafted after an intensive amount of research.

Not only you can make more persuasive arguments in this way, but you can also boost your engagement and visibility on the platform. Of course, many people use Discord font generators just for fun, and this is perfectly all right, too.

This is the only piece of software you need to alter your fonts in a number of online messaging applications, including Discord. It allows the user to access a huge number of fonts, special characters, as well as colors and combine them to get totally awesome results. The app is free to download from the App Store and works well on all Apple devices that have iOS 9.0 or later. It’s a cute little tool that will fulfill the function of a Discord font generator without taking too much space on your phone.

## Part 3: Why You Should Use Different Text Font on Discord?

Some people are content with the default text style on Discord and don’t see the need to use font generators, but advanced users enjoy the freedom of expression they gain in this way. Communication on Discord is fast-paced and it can be difficult to gain the attention of the group, which is why it makes sense to use variable and/or unusual fonts for your messages.

Not only you can make more persuasive arguments in this way, but you can also boost your engagement and visibility on the platform. Of course, many people use Discord font generators just for fun, and this is perfectly all right, too. If a few more clicks can make your experience more entertaining and more fulfilling, that’s a tradeoff worth making.

**Conclusion – Which Discord Font Generator to Choose?**

From all of the above, it’s clear that you won’t make a mistake if you try a few of the products from this list. All Discord font generators serve a similar purpose and come with comparable features, so the best way to find the right one is to play around a little bit and see which one feels the most natural to use.

Discord is a very popular platform that brings people with similar interests together and allows them to communicate using a range of textual and audiovisual elements. Still, most people use text to chat with others, which is why the fact that only one default font is available is so troublesome.

Using different fonts is a great way to make your messages more visually attractive and impress your friends. To do that, you will have to find a good Discord font generator and use it to create custom messages that include a wide variety of letter shapes.

Since there are so many online tools that can be used for generating fonts, we prepared an overview of the best options at your disposal that will present you with the strengths and weaknesses of each Discord font generator from the list.
