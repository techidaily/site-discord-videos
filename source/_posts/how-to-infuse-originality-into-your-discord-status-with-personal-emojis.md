## **Part 3: FAQs about Discord Dating Servers**

**1 - Are dating servers on discord allowed?**

Discord's director of Trust and Safety, Sean Li, says underage dating channels are against company policy. They don’t allow servers designed to access teen dating on their platform. Whenever they become aware of dating Discord servers, we quickly shut down and investigate any violating servers.

**2 - What is the number 1 discord server?**

The official Discord for the Fortnite game is the largest Discord server in the world.

**3 - What does NSFW mean in discord?**

NSFW - an internet acronym means "not safe for work." NSFW generally refers to a content warning, directing the audience to avoid the post or image or use discretion in a public or professional setting.

### Conclusion

Discord is an excellent social platform for people from all around the globe to gather and have conversations without any effort. The list mentioned above of Discord dating servers is valuable for folks looking for a mature and organized place to hang out without any restrictions.
