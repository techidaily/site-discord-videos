Hence, it’s a great platform for professionals, game lovers, and other individuals to communicate efficiently.

Part 1: What is Discord?

[Discord](https://discord.com/) is a popular platform created to offer a better communication experience between game players. The major reason for the massive recognition of Discord is its ability to generate servers instantly. Game players and other users can instantly create voice or text servers for enhanced communication.

Discord provides excellent flexibility to users by providing high-quality audio services with no background noise. Even if your friends are in different parts of the world, you can chat with them smoothly. You can create private and public servers in Discord to communicate with people having similar interests.

![discord interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-on-discord-1.jpg)

Along with using Discord Voice and Text chat features, you can live stream your gameplays. The live streaming on Discord won't be a public show, as it will only be confined to your selected server. Through this, you can ask your friends for assistance while playing games. Moreover, Discord is also capable of capturing other screens. Hence, it’s a great platform for professionals, game lovers, and other individuals to communicate efficiently.

## Part 2: Prerequisites for Stream on Discord

Check the below prerequisites for performing a **live stream on Discord**:
