Discord is a communication app targeted towards gamers. Games such as Fortnite and Among Us – a social deduction game – drove many new users to the platform

It surged in popularity during the pandemic, doubling its active monthly users to 120 million towards the end of 2020.

This popularity comes from the fact that Discord is now also being used by households and workplaces for seamless communication.

Today, we will focus on how the 'discord reply to message' feature works. This feature helps when you are trying to pick out a single message to reply to from a list of messages.

You can also include a link back to the message you respond to, making it easier for other people to follow the conversation.

You can even tag the person you are replying to so that they receive a notification whenever they log on to Discord.

In this article, we will cover the following parts on how to reply to messages on Discord:

* [Part 1: How to Reply to a Specific Message on Discord on Desktop](#part1)
* [Part 2: Replying to a Certain Message on Discord Mobile](#part2)
* [Part 3: Setting up Auto Reply on Discord with Bots](#part3)
* [Part 4: Replying to Messages with Reactions on Discord](#part4)
* [Part 5: Quoting Messages on Discord?](#part5)

## Part 1: How to Reply to a Specific Message on Discord on Desktop

This technique works for both the browser and the desktop applications; use it when replying in different discord channels or direct messaging a friend.

1. Locate the message you wish to reply to

![Reply message on Discord desktop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reply-message-on-discord.jpg)

1. Hover your cursor on the comment as you see icons on the right of the message
2. Now click on the arrow icon
3. Alternatively, you might have to click on the ellipsis icon (…) if you are replying to a comment by yourself
4. After clicking on the ellipsis icon, choose the "Reply" button
5. Write your reply in the text box. You will now see a banner telling you who you are replying to. There will also be a "@" sign over the text box, which will tag the person you respond to (this can be turned off with a click)
6. After you are done writing, press Enter to send your message. If you wish to discard the reply, you can click on "X."

![cancel  message replying on Discord desktop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cancel-reply-on-discord.jpg)

## Part 2: How to Reply to a Certain Message on Discord Mobile

Replying on the mobile app is similar to Desktop. Here's how to do it:

1. Locate the message you wish to reply to in the Discord app
2. Hold down on the comment until a list of options appears on the screen
3. Choose the "Reply" option

![reply  message  on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reply-discord-message-mobile.jpg)

1. Write your reply in the text box. Like before, the person will be tagged by default, but you can turn this off by tapping the blue "@" sign
2. After you are done writing, send the message using the enter button on your phone or tap "X" to discard the message

After pressing the send button, you should now be able to see your message in the channel.

## Part 3: How to Set Auto Reply on Discord

It may be useful to have an auto-reply feature when handling large servers. Do this by integrating a bot into your Discord server.

Here's an example of how you can implement this feature in your server. In this example, we are going to be using the Dyno bot:

1. First, you need to visit Dyno's [website](https://dyno.gg/bot) and then click on "Join us on Discord"

![auto reply  message on Discord ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-reply-bot-discord-dyno.jpg)

1. Now you will have to sign in to your Discord account from your browser
2. Next, you will have to pick which server you want to invite the bot to
3. From the same screen, you can decide which permissions to assign to the bot. The ones that matter to us are read messages and send messages

![set up permission for bots ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-dyno-permissions-discord.jpg)

1. The last step is to verify that you are not a robot yourself and check I’m not a robot.

![connect bots to Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/connect-to-discord-dyno.jpg)

After this, the Dyno bot will be added to your Discord server. To allow the bot to send messages, you need to visit Dyno's website and turn on the autoresponder, enabling you to set up your auto-reply.

## Part 4: How to Reply to Messages with Reactions on Discord

Discord allows you to react to posts with emojis. To respond with an emoji:

1. Hover your mouse cursor over the message you wish to react to
2. Click the smiley face titled "Add reaction" on the message's far-right

![add reactions to message replying on Discord ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-reactions-reply-message-discord.jpg)

1. After clicking on the "Add reaction" icon, a pop-up will appear, allowing you to choose the emoji you wish to react with.

![choosing reaction in  Discord message replying](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choose-reaction-emoji-discord.jpg)

Furthermore, to react to a message with an emoji that has already been used as a reaction, you can:

1. Click on the emoji, and it would increase the total number of responses by 1
2. Hovering over the emoji will also let you know the names of the people who reacted to the message

## Part 5: How to Quote Messages on Discord?

Quoting messages in Discord is very simple. All you need to do is type > before your quote if it is only a one-liner.

![quote message on Discord ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quote-messages-on-discord.jpg)

On the other hand, multi-line quoting is when you need to quote a paragraph or break between the lines you want to mention. For this, you can:

1. Add > after every line. However, this can become annoying
2. Instead, add >>> at the start of the paragraph you wish to quote

![multiple quote message on Discord ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/multi-line-quoting-discord.jpg)

The $9.99 subscribers can also avail of a 33% discount on other **Discord sticker packs**. Once you purchase these stickers, they are a permanent part of your Discord inventory. Other than these, the shop has Doggo Replies, Nelly At Work, and Hello Wumpus stickers as default sticker packs.

After the soft launch, the Sticker Shop is available for the users across all the platforms – Android, iOS, and even on the desktop app and browser.

## Part 2: How to Find Sticker Shop and Get Discord Stickers for Free?

If you use Discord on your desktop or browser, you can see the sticker icon right on the text bar. Tap on it, and then click on the shopping icon that appears towards the bottom (left corner). In the shop, you can browse through the sticker packs.

![Discord Stickers Browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/browser-and-buy-discord-sticker.jpg)

Nitro users will get the What's Up Wumpus stickers for free. However, they will have to buy other packs. The $9.99 Nitro users will get a 33% discount on sticker packs.

For now, the stickers can be used only by users in Japan, Brazil, and Canada. These users can send stickers to users in other countries. However, the receivers can see the stickers but cannot buy or send them.

However, you can try and use a VPN proxy to gain early access to it.

## Part 3: How to Buy Discord Stickers?

As we described above, you can access the sticker shop on your phone as well as desktop. Once in the shop, you can browse and pick the stickers to buy.

Before buying, you can view the stickers in the sticker pack. As a sample, you will be shown a few stickers. You can view the entire pack by tapping on the 'View All' tab.

## Part 4: How to Buy or Redeem a Discord Sticker Pack

Here is a brief rundown of the steps to follow if you want to buy a sticker pack.

* Choose a sticker pack that you like. View all the stickers to see what the pack looks like.
* Tap on the purchase button that is located right beside the name of the pack.
* You will be prompted to input your payment details. If you have saved a payment option on Discord, you can choose the relevant option.
* Agree to the Terms and Services of Discord.
* Finally, hit the purchase tab.
* The sticker pack is added to the inventory instantly.
* You can start sending them in the texts.

Note that Discord does not refund the money that is once paid. So, you cannot return the stickers to get a refund.

Another interesting thing to note is that the Sticker Shop refreshes and offers new sticker packs. Due to this rotation, a pack that is available in the shop today may be replaced by a new one tomorrow.

But don't worry. A timer displayed at the top left corner (besides the title) lets you know for how long the pack is available in the shop. You can grab it before the time runs out.

### 2\. Sending Stickers from Discord Desktop (and over Browser)

### Step 1\. Download and install the latest version of Filmora

Click the button below to download and install the latest version of Filmora. If you have installed Filmora already, click the **About** option under the **Help** menu to check the version of Filmora.

Note: You need to run Filmora 10.5 and later versions to add the AR stickers.

### Step 2\. Drag and drop your video footage to timeline

After launching Filmora, you need to import the video footage to the video editor. You can drag and drop the video footage to the timeline directly if you are working on a simple video project.

However, if you are working on a video project with many footages, it is recommended to upload them to the media library in order.

### Step 3\. Add AR Stickers to the video

## FAQs about Discord Sticker

And here we will answer some stuff that you might wonder about.

1. **What’s the difference between Discord Sticker and [Discord Emoji](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)?**

Well, emojis are emojis, and they are even in-built into your Android (or Google) and other keyboards on your phone. Emojis are not animated, and you can send basic Smiley or Sad faces (of course, there are animals and flowers, too). On the other hand, stickers are animated, and there can be specific sticker characters like What's Up Wumpus.

1. **Why can't I see the Sticker option on my Discord app?**

You cannot access the stickers on Discord probably because the feature has not been launched in your country yet. Stickers are only available for users in Brazil, Japan, and Canada. They will be launched in other countries after testing and feedback.

1. **Is Discord sticker free?**

If you are a Nitro subscriber, you will get the What’s Up Wumpus sticker pack for free. You will have to buy the other packs. As a $9.99 Nitro subscriber, you can get other packs at a 33% discount.

1. **Can I keep the purchased sticker pack forever in my account?**

Yes, once you buy a pack, you will have lifetime access to it. However, if you delete your Discord account, you will not get your stickers back. Further, packs like ‘Wumpus Nitro Elite’ can be accessed only on an active $9.99 subscription.

1. **Can people who are outside of Brazil, Canada, and Japan receive the stickers I sent?**

Yes, users from countries other than Japan, Canada, and Brazil can see the stickers in the chat sent to them. However, they could not buy or send them.

1. **Why my Discord sticker is not moving/animating?**

The stickers should move by default when sent. You can check if your sticker inventory is set to the smallest size. You can also go to User Settings, tap on Text & Images, and select Stickers. Adjust the settings appropriately. You can contact the Discord support team should you need further assistance.

Be patient until the cool update rolls out worldwide!

The $9.99 subscribers can also avail of a 33% discount on other **Discord sticker packs**. Once you purchase these stickers, they are a permanent part of your Discord inventory. Other than these, the shop has Doggo Replies, Nelly At Work, and Hello Wumpus stickers as default sticker packs.

After the soft launch, the Sticker Shop is available for the users across all the platforms – Android, iOS, and even on the desktop app and browser.

## Part 2: How to Find Sticker Shop and Get Discord Stickers for Free?

### \- On Phone

If you are lucky enough to be in Brazil, Japan, or Canada, you can access the Sticker Shop. You can tap on the emoji icon (the one that appears on the text box). The box that opens shows the emoji, and GIF tabs along with the sticker tab.

Tap on the sticker tab. A 'shop' symbol pops up towards the bottom (right hand). Tap on the symbol to open the sticker gallery. Here, you will see all the available sticker packs.

### \- Desktop (Browser)

![Discord Sticker Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-stickers-options.jpg)

If you use Discord on your desktop or browser, you can see the sticker icon right on the text bar. Tap on it, and then click on the shopping icon that appears towards the bottom (left corner). In the shop, you can browse through the sticker packs.

![Discord Stickers Browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/browser-and-buy-discord-sticker.jpg)

Nitro users will get the What's Up Wumpus stickers for free. However, they will have to buy other packs. The $9.99 Nitro users will get a 33% discount on sticker packs.

For now, the stickers can be used only by users in Japan, Brazil, and Canada. These users can send stickers to users in other countries. However, the receivers can see the stickers but cannot buy or send them.

However, you can try and use a VPN proxy to gain early access to it.

## Part 3: How to Buy Discord Stickers?

As we described above, you can access the sticker shop on your phone as well as desktop. Once in the shop, you can browse and pick the stickers to buy.

Before buying, you can view the stickers in the sticker pack. As a sample, you will be shown a few stickers. You can view the entire pack by tapping on the 'View All' tab.

## Part 4: How to Buy or Redeem a Discord Sticker Pack

Here is a brief rundown of the steps to follow if you want to buy a sticker pack.

* Choose a sticker pack that you like. View all the stickers to see what the pack looks like.
* Tap on the purchase button that is located right beside the name of the pack.
* You will be prompted to input your payment details. If you have saved a payment option on Discord, you can choose the relevant option.
* Agree to the Terms and Services of Discord.
* Finally, hit the purchase tab.
* The sticker pack is added to the inventory instantly.
* You can start sending them in the texts.

Note that Discord does not refund the money that is once paid. So, you cannot return the stickers to get a refund.

Another interesting thing to note is that the Sticker Shop refreshes and offers new sticker packs. Due to this rotation, a pack that is available in the shop today may be replaced by a new one tomorrow.

But don't worry. A timer displayed at the top left corner (besides the title) lets you know for how long the pack is available in the shop. You can grab it before the time runs out.

## Part 5: How to Use Stickers on Discord?

Buying stickers is useless if you don't send them over texts. So, once you purchase stickers, you can immediately start sending them to your servers and texts.

### 1\. Sending Stickers on Discord Mobile App

![ send Discord Stickers on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sending-stickers-discord-mobile.jpg)

If you have the Discord app on your phone, tap on the emoji button. The Stickers tab appears, and this menu enables you to send the most-used stickers quickly, view all the purchased stickers, and search for appropriate stickers.

You can type an expression or emoji in the ‘Find the perfect sticker’ bar to find the right sticker. Hit the send button once you find the apt sticker.

### 2\. Sending Stickers from Discord Desktop (and over Browser)

![send Discord Stickers online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/send-sticker-discord-desktop-online.jpg)

Sending stickers on a desktop or browser is quite similar to the mobile process. On the chatbox, you will find the sticker icon. Tap on it to view your purchased sticker packs.

Once opened, the menu will show you the most-used stickers. You can view other packs and switch between them. You can also search for particular stickers by typing the terms on the search bar.

You can tap on a sticker to send it on chats and servers.

## Bonus: Adding Face-tracking AR Stickers to Video with [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

In the latest version of Wondershare Filmora (V10.5 and later version), you can add face-tracking AR stickers to people in the video, and light up the celebration with flashy and cute characters and elements. Here are some brief steps to add AR stickers to your video in Filmora.

### Step 1\. Download and install the latest version of Filmora

Click the button below to download and install the latest version of Filmora. If you have installed Filmora already, click the **About** option under the **Help** menu to check the version of Filmora.

[![Download Filmora  Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora   Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Note: You need to run Filmora 10.5 and later versions to add the AR stickers.

### Step 2\. Drag and drop your video footage to timeline

After launching Filmora, you need to import the video footage to the video editor. You can drag and drop the video footage to the timeline directly if you are working on a simple video project.

However, if you are working on a video project with many footages, it is recommended to upload them to the media library in order.

### Step 3\. Add AR Stickers to the video

After trimming or cutting out unnecessary frames from the video, you can now add the AR stickers to the footage. Go to the Effects tab and then scroll down to the **AR Sticker** directory.

To add a sticker to the video, you can drag and drop it to the video track above or to the video clip directly. You can add several stickers at the same time by placing them in the tracks accordingly.

## FAQs about Discord Sticker

And here we will answer some stuff that you might wonder about.

1. **What’s the difference between Discord Sticker and [Discord Emoji](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)?**

Well, emojis are emojis, and they are even in-built into your Android (or Google) and other keyboards on your phone. Emojis are not animated, and you can send basic Smiley or Sad faces (of course, there are animals and flowers, too). On the other hand, stickers are animated, and there can be specific sticker characters like What's Up Wumpus.

1. **Why can't I see the Sticker option on my Discord app?**

You cannot access the stickers on Discord probably because the feature has not been launched in your country yet. Stickers are only available for users in Brazil, Japan, and Canada. They will be launched in other countries after testing and feedback.

1. **Is Discord sticker free?**

If you are a Nitro subscriber, you will get the What’s Up Wumpus sticker pack for free. You will have to buy the other packs. As a $9.99 Nitro subscriber, you can get other packs at a 33% discount.

1. **Can I keep the purchased sticker pack forever in my account?**

Yes, once you buy a pack, you will have lifetime access to it. However, if you delete your Discord account, you will not get your stickers back. Further, packs like ‘Wumpus Nitro Elite’ can be accessed only on an active $9.99 subscription.

1. **Can people who are outside of Brazil, Canada, and Japan receive the stickers I sent?**

Yes, users from countries other than Japan, Canada, and Brazil can see the stickers in the chat sent to them. However, they could not buy or send them.

1. **Why my Discord sticker is not moving/animating?**

The stickers should move by default when sent. You can check if your sticker inventory is set to the smallest size. You can also go to User Settings, tap on Text & Images, and select Stickers. Adjust the settings appropriately. You can contact the Discord support team should you need further assistance.

Be patient until the cool update rolls out worldwide!
