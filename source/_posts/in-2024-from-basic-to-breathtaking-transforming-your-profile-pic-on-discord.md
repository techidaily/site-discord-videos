Discord is the creation of gamers, but it shouldn’t scare you off. This free video and text chat service is now a prominent platform for anyone looking to start public or private communities.

Discord lets friends communicate directly via video, voice, or text and join servers where larger communities can hang up.

However, any online community can access the features Discord provides.

In this guide, we're going to dive into how to create your aesthetic **Discord PFP** beginning with the requirements, top Discord PFPs 2021, and a tool to create your own PFP for Discord.

* [Part 2: Best 5 Discord PFP](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Design a Discord PFP Avatar in Filmora?](#part3)
* [Part 4: Best 3 Websites to Grow Your Discord Server PFP](#part4)

## **Part 1: An Introduction to PFP for Discord**

Every element on any social platform contributes to the overall user’s impression. His profile picture or Discord PFP is one of the most effective elements that go a long way towards branding.

**Note**: Discord users can only use a single avatar or profile picture on the platform and can't switch between servers.

Keeping this in mind, selecting a cool PFP for Discord helps you represent yourself everywhere on the Discord platform.

#### Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance

Like all other online communication platforms, Discord has rules regarding the suitability of specific images and the use of an avatar.

Firstly, you must know the size limit of images which shouldn’t be too large as it can affect the channel. On the other hand, too small images may look bad and are not legible due to pixelization.

The ideal images size for your Discord PFP is at least 512 x 512 pixels – enough to be visible and far above the 180 x 180-pixel minimum.

Discord allows photographs and various types of cartoon images, memes, and illustrations and accepts JPG and the Discord GIF PFP.

Also, there are community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your Discord PFP submission might get rejected for failing to meet Discord’s terms and conditions.

No NSFW images are allowed on Discord. Explicit nudity or pornographic content is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality or showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions.

## **Part 2: Best 5 Discord PFP**

Discord is overrun with anime/videogame and other cool PFP for Discord. If you’re unfamiliar with either of these, selecting a PFP for Discord can be a challenge.

So today, we have devised a selection of the 5 best of what we believe are the best Discord profile pictures.

#### 1. My Hero Academia – Midoriya Izuku

![my hero academia discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/my-hero-academia-discord.jpg)

This is a lowkey one. This picture of a young Midoriya Izuku gives a very tired and sleepy vibe. The poor child doesn’t know what the future holds for him.

#### 2. Re:Zero – Rem-Rin

![rem rin discord pfp](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-pfp-rem-rin.jpg)

Rem, the anime character stole everyone's heart who watched the show in 2016\. With Season 2 over the head, this is the perfect opportunity to show that you're on team Rem.

#### 3. Kermit The Frog – Everyone Loves Kermit

![kermit frog discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/kermit-frog-discord.jpg)

We all love Kermit, the frog. Use his smiling picture to make everyone's day just a tad bit better.

#### 4. Shrek – Meme Face

![shrek discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shrek-discord.jpg)

If cuteness isn't up your alley, here's a funny profile picture. Poor Shrek, what have they done to your beautiful face.

![discord pfp persona 5 joker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-pfp-persona-joker.jpg)

If you're a Persona franchise fan of the Persona franchise, I offer this profile picture to you. The joker, looking as stunning as always.

## **Part 3: How to Design a Discord PFP Avatar in Filmora?**

If you are also among the users who decide to create custom anime Discord PFPor other PFP for Discord, this option is highly advisable to unveil your creative skills.

It is an effort to make a fantastic Discord PFPor avatar that will be unique and exactly narrates your story behind the brand. You can use many different software tools for this purpose, but since the task is effortless, you can use an accessible and practical program such as Filmora.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The process of designing a PFP for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complicated and consists of just a few simple steps.

Begin by selecting or choosing the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be a real-life photo or an animated avatar. You can download from some discord PFP sites or directly search on Google.

Next, upload the chosen image into a new project and then resize it to fit preferred Discord dimensions. To modify the shape, click **Effects** \-> **Utility** \-> **Image Mask** to optimize **PFP for Discord**.

![create discord avatar Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-overlay-image-mask-discord-profile-wondershare-filmora.jpg)

By adding overlays to the primary image, you can further enhance its visual or textual elements to customize the Discord PFPavatar.

And, you can also consider using Discord GIF PFPsto get maximum attention. A GIF avatar that jumps off the page in every chat you are a part of highlights a strong vibe of creativity.

## **Part 4: Best 3 Websites to Grow Your Discord Server PFP**

There are different ways to carry our Discord server growth, and one of them is to submit your Discord server to server directories or websites that allow you to post a listing for your server.

### 1\. [Disboard](https://disboard.org/servers)

![discord server pfp disboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-server-pfp-disboard.jpg)

Disboard is one of the demanding server listing sites out there, and

As severs here are browsed by category, ensure that you select the correct category while adding it to your listing.

No matter you have a music server or a gaming server, there's sure to be a category for your server, and if not, there's also an "other" server category, so fear not!

### 2.[Top.gg](https://top.gg/servers)

![top gg discord server](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-gg-discord-server.jpg)

Top.gg, which is a bot, is another best server listing site. It helps you submit listings for both your servers and bots with a fantastic user interface.

The listings display the number of emotes available, the voting mechanism, as well as your server's description.

Servers categorize through tags, including Anime, Music, and 30 plus other categories to explore better.

A cool feature of the site is the users' comments on the custom server listing pages so that you can enjoy a great community.

### 3\. [Discord Servers.com](https://discordservers.com/server/536415342411644929)

![discord servers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-servers-pfp.jpg)

If you're hoping to grow Discord server and its associated Discord PFP, Discord Servers is another preferred server listing website.

It allows users to submit your listing on category pages, including Minecraft, Programming, Anime, and other categories. And, there are high chances that you will find your category on this server as it's quite vast.

However, adding your Discord server to this listing will require a bot to be added to your server.

### Conclusion

So, this was the gist of creating fantastic Discord PFPs in 2021! With the top-performing examples of PFPs for Discord, you can take a hint and follow your own rules of creativity with Wondershare Filmora – your only Discord PFP avatar maker!

## **Part 3: How to Design a Discord PFP Avatar in Filmora?**

If you are also among the users who decide to create custom anime Discord PFPor other PFP for Discord, this option is highly advisable to unveil your creative skills.

It is an effort to make a fantastic Discord PFPor avatar that will be unique and exactly narrates your story behind the brand. You can use many different software tools for this purpose, but since the task is effortless, you can use an accessible and practical program such as Filmora.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The process of designing a PFP for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complicated and consists of just a few simple steps.

Begin by selecting or choosing the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be a real-life photo or an animated avatar. You can download from some discord PFP sites or directly search on Google.

Next, upload the chosen image into a new project and then resize it to fit preferred Discord dimensions. To modify the shape, click **Effects** \-> **Utility** \-> **Image Mask** to optimize **PFP for Discord**.

![create discord avatar Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-overlay-image-mask-discord-profile-wondershare-filmora.jpg)

By adding overlays to the primary image, you can further enhance its visual or textual elements to customize the Discord PFPavatar.

And, you can also consider using Discord GIF PFPsto get maximum attention. A GIF avatar that jumps off the page in every chat you are a part of highlights a strong vibe of creativity.

## **Part 4: Best 3 Websites to Grow Your Discord Server PFP**

There are different ways to carry our Discord server growth, and one of them is to submit your Discord server to server directories or websites that allow you to post a listing for your server.

### 1\. [Disboard](https://disboard.org/servers)

![discord server pfp disboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-server-pfp-disboard.jpg)

Disboard is one of the demanding server listing sites out there, and

As severs here are browsed by category, ensure that you select the correct category while adding it to your listing.

No matter you have a music server or a gaming server, there's sure to be a category for your server, and if not, there's also an "other" server category, so fear not!

### 2.[Top.gg](https://top.gg/servers)

![top gg discord server](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-gg-discord-server.jpg)

Top.gg, which is a bot, is another best server listing site. It helps you submit listings for both your servers and bots with a fantastic user interface.

The listings display the number of emotes available, the voting mechanism, as well as your server's description.

Servers categorize through tags, including Anime, Music, and 30 plus other categories to explore better.

A cool feature of the site is the users' comments on the custom server listing pages so that you can enjoy a great community.

### 3\. [Discord Servers.com](https://discordservers.com/server/536415342411644929)

![discord servers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-servers-pfp.jpg)

If you're hoping to grow Discord server and its associated Discord PFP, Discord Servers is another preferred server listing website.

It allows users to submit your listing on category pages, including Minecraft, Programming, Anime, and other categories. And, there are high chances that you will find your category on this server as it's quite vast.

However, adding your Discord server to this listing will require a bot to be added to your server.

### Conclusion

So, this was the gist of creating fantastic Discord PFPs in 2021! With the top-performing examples of PFPs for Discord, you can take a hint and follow your own rules of creativity with Wondershare Filmora – your only Discord PFP avatar maker!

Discord is one of the fastest-growing instant communication platforms. It started as just a messaging and [voice chat app for gamers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) but today it has expanded into every PC.

## Part 1: What is Discord Music Bot?

Discord allows users to create servers where they can then invite their friends or people who have the same interest, or people playing the same game. Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.

**Discord music bots** provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time. Discord music bots can find songs on YouTube, Spotify, or other platforms and play them on a Discord voice channel.

### 7. BMO [](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/418412306981191680)

This Music bot was inspired by the Adventure-Time Character BMO. This music bot is fun to use and provides the functionality of a high level of bot.

It is the best bot, in my opinion, to liven up your server especially if it has a general chat room.

**Pros**

* Smooth lag-free High-Quality Music.
* Small chat games to make a user's time on your server more fun.
* NSFW commands for those channels as well.
* The bot is also DMCA protected which means it’s not violating any copyright laws.

### 8. 24/7 [](https://24-7music.com)

24/7 is another one of my favorite free music bots. It not only provides high-quality music streaming from major websites like YouTube, Spotify, and mixer. But it also allows streaming from any radio station around the world.

24/7 was created by Deluxe to provide non-stop music for its users. It has a small number of commands to keep it concise and to the point.

* mb play \[link to internet radio stream\]
* mb pause \*
* mb resume \*
* mb np
* mb volume \[volume percentage\] \*
* mb help

_\[\] = optional parameter_

_\* = premium only commands_

The premium version can be bought for $2.47 which along with the commands unlocks these features:

#### Premium features of 24/7

\- YouTube queue, including pause, resume, skip, add, remove, export, import, etc.

\- YouTube playlist support

\- control the volume, server-wide

But if you like the bot you can get the $7.24 version which provides all the above-mentioned benefits and a message on your server stating that you donated to the creators of this bot.

**Pros**

The Best thing about 24/7 is that it can stream any live event from Youtube as well. So, you can listen to a talk show, a podcast, or any other live event while playing your favorite games.

### 9. [Mantaro](https://mantaro.site/)

A personal favorite that I have on my server is Mantaro. It, like all the bots mentioned before, provides great quality music streaming from all major sources.

This bot is the go-to for an anime lover or an anime discord server. It comes with everything you need to make it fun, lively, and interactive even when people aren’t playing games and just chatting.

**Pros**

* Mantaro has so many features. From a currency system to mining activities, gifts, XP, chopping, fishing, pets, and everything.
* Birthday roles and announcements.
* Games (such as trivia, guess the character, guess the number, and guess the Pokémon _remember that on the TV back then?_)
* Anime and Character lookup command. And don’t forget the NSFW commands for lewd anime pics.
* It also provides RP commands for all the RP lovers out there.

Mantaro makes your server into more of a second life for you.

### 10. [ErisBot](https://erisbot.com/)

ErisBot is a strong and very simple-to-use music bot.

The best feature about ErisBot that separates it from the rest is that it allows you to create your very own custom prefixes for the commands.

One thing I noticed is that sometimes instead of playing audio from the YouTube link, it starts playing the video. Maybe it mixes up the commands or whatever. This is something you’ll have to keep in mind while using Eris Bot.

## Part 3: How to Add a Music Bot to Discord?

Adding a music bot to your server is very simple and only takes one click. Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.

This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.

Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.

After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members' area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.

## Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?

Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.

Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type _–help_ for Groovy and similarly for every other bot (\[specified prefix\]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.

Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.

You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the _–loop track_ command. And loop your whole queue using –_loop queue_. You can turn the loop off by –_loop off_.

If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the _–queue_ command.

In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.

## Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?

Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use [Filmore Discord video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size. Filmora owns popular video effects and filters to make your video look professional, plus, it possesses a huge library that offers multiple music tracks for you to use.

### 7. BMO [](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/418412306981191680)

This Music bot was inspired by the Adventure-Time Character BMO. This music bot is fun to use and provides the functionality of a high level of bot.

It is the best bot, in my opinion, to liven up your server especially if it has a general chat room.

**Pros**

* Smooth lag-free High-Quality Music.
* Small chat games to make a user's time on your server more fun.
* NSFW commands for those channels as well.
* The bot is also DMCA protected which means it’s not violating any copyright laws.

### 8. 24/7 [](https://24-7music.com)

24/7 is another one of my favorite free music bots. It not only provides high-quality music streaming from major websites like YouTube, Spotify, and mixer. But it also allows streaming from any radio station around the world.

24/7 was created by Deluxe to provide non-stop music for its users. It has a small number of commands to keep it concise and to the point.

* mb play \[link to internet radio stream\]
* mb pause \*
* mb resume \*
* mb np
* mb volume \[volume percentage\] \*
* mb help

_\[\] = optional parameter_

_\* = premium only commands_

The premium version can be bought for $2.47 which along with the commands unlocks these features:

#### Premium features of 24/7

\- YouTube queue, including pause, resume, skip, add, remove, export, import, etc.

\- YouTube playlist support

\- control the volume, server-wide

But if you like the bot you can get the $7.24 version which provides all the above-mentioned benefits and a message on your server stating that you donated to the creators of this bot.

**Pros**

The Best thing about 24/7 is that it can stream any live event from Youtube as well. So, you can listen to a talk show, a podcast, or any other live event while playing your favorite games.

### 9. [Mantaro](https://mantaro.site/)

A personal favorite that I have on my server is Mantaro. It, like all the bots mentioned before, provides great quality music streaming from all major sources.

This bot is the go-to for an anime lover or an anime discord server. It comes with everything you need to make it fun, lively, and interactive even when people aren’t playing games and just chatting.

**Pros**

* Mantaro has so many features. From a currency system to mining activities, gifts, XP, chopping, fishing, pets, and everything.
* Birthday roles and announcements.
* Games (such as trivia, guess the character, guess the number, and guess the Pokémon _remember that on the TV back then?_)
* Anime and Character lookup command. And don’t forget the NSFW commands for lewd anime pics.
* It also provides RP commands for all the RP lovers out there.

Mantaro makes your server into more of a second life for you.

### 10. [ErisBot](https://erisbot.com/)

ErisBot is a strong and very simple-to-use music bot.

The best feature about ErisBot that separates it from the rest is that it allows you to create your very own custom prefixes for the commands.

One thing I noticed is that sometimes instead of playing audio from the YouTube link, it starts playing the video. Maybe it mixes up the commands or whatever. This is something you’ll have to keep in mind while using Eris Bot.

## Part 3: How to Add a Music Bot to Discord?

Adding a music bot to your server is very simple and only takes one click. Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.

This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.

Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.

After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members' area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.

## Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?

Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.

Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type _–help_ for Groovy and similarly for every other bot (\[specified prefix\]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.

Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.

You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the _–loop track_ command. And loop your whole queue using –_loop queue_. You can turn the loop off by –_loop off_.

If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the _–queue_ command.

In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.

## Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?

Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use [Filmore Discord video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size. Filmora owns popular video effects and filters to make your video look professional, plus, it possesses a huge library that offers multiple music tracks for you to use.

### 4. [FredBoat](https://fredboat.com/)

One of my personal favorite free music bots is FredBoat. It’s more like a Spotify inside discord. It can play from Youtube, Spotify, Soundcloud, and even twitch.

FredBoat allows you to create your very own playlist which you can then play from inside discord by just typing out one command. You can also stream live from YouTube and Twitch.

FredBoat was originally created for smaller servers but it now also provides a permission system to keep trolls at bay.

**Pros**

* FredBoat has a built-in search system. So instead of using a youtube link to play something, you search it up directly from inside discord.
* FredBoat is a secure and open-source bot which makes it trustworthy and competent.

### 5. [Vexera](https://vexera.io/)

Vexera is another free music bot to increase the discord experience for you and your friends. It gives smooth lag-free music playback with High Quality. It’s currently a part of over 300,000+ discord servers which proves its worth and trust level.

Vexera is a multi-purpose bot. Along with music it also provides moderation and automatic Greeting and Farewell messages to whoever enters or leaves your server.

**Pros**

* Along with music streaming commands, it also provides other management commands like sending greeting messages to new users in your discord server.
* Allows simple playback from the WebPanel or through discord commands.

![discord music bot - vexera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/discord-music-bot-3.png)

### 6. [MEE6](https://mee6.xyz/)

In my opinion, MEE6 is the most diverse discord Music Bot with not only music but many more features all in one. It allows you to play smooth and fast High-Quality music while providing administrative and recreational features as well.

It also provides amazing auto-moderation to keep your server safe from trolls, toxicity, and abusive language by auto muting, banning or kicking people according to your specific set instructions.

**Pros**

* Provides greeting messages for new users entering your discord server.
* Allows you to create custom commands to add more functionality to your server.
* Grants auto-roles and has an XP system to see how much a user is live and interacts. Which can be further used to give out rewards to the most active users and so on.
* Highly customizable administration to protect your server from trolls, spam, and toxic users.
* Easy to set up announcement plugin.

### 7. BMO [](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/418412306981191680)

This Music bot was inspired by the Adventure-Time Character BMO. This music bot is fun to use and provides the functionality of a high level of bot.

It is the best bot, in my opinion, to liven up your server especially if it has a general chat room.

**Pros**

* Smooth lag-free High-Quality Music.
* Small chat games to make a user's time on your server more fun.
* NSFW commands for those channels as well.
* The bot is also DMCA protected which means it’s not violating any copyright laws.

### 8. 24/7 [](https://24-7music.com)

24/7 is another one of my favorite free music bots. It not only provides high-quality music streaming from major websites like YouTube, Spotify, and mixer. But it also allows streaming from any radio station around the world.

24/7 was created by Deluxe to provide non-stop music for its users. It has a small number of commands to keep it concise and to the point.

* mb play \[link to internet radio stream\]
* mb pause \*
* mb resume \*
* mb np
* mb volume \[volume percentage\] \*
* mb help

_\[\] = optional parameter_

_\* = premium only commands_

The premium version can be bought for $2.47 which along with the commands unlocks these features:

#### Premium features of 24/7

\- YouTube queue, including pause, resume, skip, add, remove, export, import, etc.

\- YouTube playlist support

\- control the volume, server-wide

But if you like the bot you can get the $7.24 version which provides all the above-mentioned benefits and a message on your server stating that you donated to the creators of this bot.

**Pros**

The Best thing about 24/7 is that it can stream any live event from Youtube as well. So, you can listen to a talk show, a podcast, or any other live event while playing your favorite games.

### 9. [Mantaro](https://mantaro.site/)

A personal favorite that I have on my server is Mantaro. It, like all the bots mentioned before, provides great quality music streaming from all major sources.

This bot is the go-to for an anime lover or an anime discord server. It comes with everything you need to make it fun, lively, and interactive even when people aren’t playing games and just chatting.

**Pros**

* Mantaro has so many features. From a currency system to mining activities, gifts, XP, chopping, fishing, pets, and everything.
* Birthday roles and announcements.
* Games (such as trivia, guess the character, guess the number, and guess the Pokémon _remember that on the TV back then?_)
* Anime and Character lookup command. And don’t forget the NSFW commands for lewd anime pics.
* It also provides RP commands for all the RP lovers out there.

Mantaro makes your server into more of a second life for you.

### 10. [ErisBot](https://erisbot.com/)

ErisBot is a strong and very simple-to-use music bot.

The best feature about ErisBot that separates it from the rest is that it allows you to create your very own custom prefixes for the commands.

One thing I noticed is that sometimes instead of playing audio from the YouTube link, it starts playing the video. Maybe it mixes up the commands or whatever. This is something you’ll have to keep in mind while using Eris Bot.

## Part 3: How to Add a Music Bot to Discord?

Adding a music bot to your server is very simple and only takes one click. Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.

This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.

Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.

After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members' area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.

## Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?

Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.

Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type _–help_ for Groovy and similarly for every other bot (\[specified prefix\]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.

Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.

You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the _–loop track_ command. And loop your whole queue using –_loop queue_. You can turn the loop off by –_loop off_.

If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the _–queue_ command.

In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.

## Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?

Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use [Filmore Discord video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size. Filmora owns popular video effects and filters to make your video look professional, plus, it possesses a huge library that offers multiple music tracks for you to use.

See how powerful the Filmora is!
