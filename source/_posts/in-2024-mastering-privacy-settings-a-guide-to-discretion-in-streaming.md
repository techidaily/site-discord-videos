Discord has completely transformed online communication, becoming the preferred platform for gamers, streamers, and reviewers alike.

As of late, it has started integrating with other gaming and streaming services, giving us the streamer mode. With streaming's growing popularity, it's essential to know what the streamer mode is all about.

If you're a gamer, Discord's streamer mode allows you to stream your gaming session to viewers by broadcasting your game to your friends, fans, and even a closed community of enthusiasts.

Many e-gaming professionals have taken up streaming, offering original and valuable content for like-minded individuals. This mode helps them streamline all their communications in one place.

If you're new to Discord’s streamer mode, you need to know what it is, how you can use it to engage with other community members, and the primary security concerns you need to be aware of.

* [Part 5: Discord Streaming Tips](#part5)

We have compiled a list of steps to help you learn how to conduct Discord streaming from the most prominent platforms: Windows, Mac, Chromebook, iPhone, Android.

## Part 1: How to Stream on Discord from Desktop Computers

### How to Stream on Discord from Windows

Discord allows for streaming through its Windows desktop client. You can stream games, podcasts, and any other kind of content through it.

However, it is crucial to remember that you can only stream in 480p and 720p resolutions in the free version. If you want higher resolution streaming, subscribe to Discord Nitro, which costs $9.99 a month.

With that said, follow these steps to start Discord streaming:

1. Start the game that you want to stream and then switch back to Discord
2. You will find an icon at the bottom left of the window displaying the name of the game you started and a stream icon resembling a camera next to it. Click on this icon to begin streaming
3. The Screen Share menu will pop-up displaying the game you have started, and from the ‘Select a voice channel’ drop-down, select the channel you want to stream with
4. Adjust your screen resolution and frame rates according to your choice
5. After you’ve made all the adjustments, you can hit the ‘Go Live’ button at the bottom right of the window to start streaming.

If you wish to stop streaming, click on the ‘Stop Streaming’ icon at the app's bottom-left corner

Additionally, if you wish to stream voice and video calls on your Discord server, you can do so as well. To make a call to your friends through Discord:

1. Open the Discord app on your Windows PC and then select the server you want to use
2. Click the General Voice channel to place a voice connection with Discord
3. On the bottom left of the window, you will see a Voice Connected entry. If you wish to video call, click on the ‘Video’ button; otherwise, click on the ‘Screen’ button for screen sharing
4. When you click ‘Video,’ your screen’s center will switch to conversation mode, and you will be able to see your camera feed
5. If you click on the screen, a pop-up window shows up, allowing you to select the application you want to share
6. After setting this up, your friends can join your call by clicking on the General channel

When you want to end the call, click on the red Disconnect icon

### How to Stream on Discord from Mac

To achieve the same result with Discord on a Mac:

1. Open the Discord app on your Macintosh and then find and join a voice channel that allows you to stream (you can find out which channels will let you stream by joining the channel and checking if you can click on ‘Video’ or ‘Screen’ at the bottom of the window)
2. Once you’ve made sure that the channel allows you to stream, you can choose whether you want to stream from your webcam or share your computer screen. Click on the option you want
3. If you’ve selected the ‘Video’ option, this will turn on your webcam after a prompt, and it will start streaming immediately
4. If you’ve selected the screen-sharing option, choose the window you’d like to share, and it will start broadcasting the specific window
5. You can either share your entire screen or specific windows, depending on your choice
6. Choose a resolution and frame rate for the stream, but remember that higher resolutions and frame rates take up more bandwidth
7. If you’re streaming from your desktop, you can even stream in sound. Toggle the sound button to the right, and you will be able to access your microphone for the stream
8. When you’ve decided all the parameters and feel you’re ready to stream, click on ‘Go Live’

## Part 2: How to Stream on Discord from Chromebook

Chromebooks have a customized Android operating software that can fit the laptop, functioning seamlessly with its requirements.

However, because Chromebooks use a restrictive OS, the Discord app functions like it would on a smartphone or tablet.

Therefore, for Discord streaming on a Chromebook, you will have to:

1. Select a voice channel and then join it
2. Press the Video camera icon to share your screen
3. Allow the program camera access
4. Begin streaming

However, it is slightly challenging to join voice channels using the app. To do this, you will have to:

1. Locate the voice channel and click on it
2. Upon clicking, you will see a window appear at the bottom
3. Scroll to the bottom of the menu, and click on the ‘Join Channel’ button
4. To join with the camera, click on the camcorder icon

## Part 3: How to Stream on Discord from iPhone And Android

Although Discord does not allow users to broadcast content from the Discord Mobile app, they can still share their screen to stream games and videos. To do so, they must:

1. Select a voice channel and join it
2. Press the Video camera icon for screen-sharing
3. Then allow permission to third-party apps on the mobile to access your camera
4. Press the Camera icon to allow the program access to your camera
5. Once this is done, you are now streaming live

It is important to note that while sharing your screen on Discord, make sure you are not divulging any crucial details with other users in the form of notifications.

To avoid incoming notifications, put your mobile on airplane mode.

## Part 4: How to Watch Discord Streaming

Aside from broadcasting streams, you can also watch other users streaming their content on Discord. To watch someone’s stream, you will need to:

1. Go to the voice channel where someone is streaming and click on their name
2. If you’ve decided you want to join their stream, click on ‘Join Stream’
3. You can also click on ‘Watch Stream’ from the main chat screen on your Discord

When someone is streaming content on Discord, you can see a red ‘Live’ icon next to their name. Knowing this will make it easier to tell when your favorite users are streaming.

## Part 5: Discord Streaming Tips

To help you get the max out of your Discord streaming experience, we’ve compiled a couple of tips:

4. Right-click Discord
5. Click Uninstall
6. After it is uninstalled, reinstall it once again

4. When you click ‘Video,’ your screen’s center will switch to conversation mode, and you will be able to see your camera feed
5. If you click on the screen, a pop-up window shows up, allowing you to select the application you want to share

### How to Stream on Discord from Mac

To achieve the same result with Discord on a Mac:

1. Open the Discord app on your Macintosh and then find and join a voice channel that allows you to stream (you can find out which channels will let you stream by joining the channel and checking if you can click on ‘Video’ or ‘Screen’ at the bottom of the window)
2. Once you’ve made sure that the channel allows you to stream, you can choose whether you want to stream from your webcam or share your computer screen. Click on the option you want
3. If you’ve selected the ‘Video’ option, this will turn on your webcam after a prompt, and it will start streaming immediately
4. If you’ve selected the screen-sharing option, choose the window you’d like to share, and it will start broadcasting the specific window
5. You can either share your entire screen or specific windows, depending on your choice
6. Choose a resolution and frame rate for the stream, but remember that higher resolutions and frame rates take up more bandwidth
7. If you’re streaming from your desktop, you can even stream in sound. Toggle the sound button to the right, and you will be able to access your microphone for the stream
8. When you’ve decided all the parameters and feel you’re ready to stream, click on ‘Go Live’

## Part 2: How to Stream on Discord from Chromebook

Chromebooks have a customized Android operating software that can fit the laptop, functioning seamlessly with its requirements.

However, because Chromebooks use a restrictive OS, the Discord app functions like it would on a smartphone or tablet.

Therefore, for Discord streaming on a Chromebook, you will have to:

1. Select a voice channel and then join it
2. Press the Video camera icon to share your screen
3. Allow the program camera access
4. Begin streaming

However, it is slightly challenging to join voice channels using the app. To do this, you will have to:

1. Locate the voice channel and click on it
2. Upon clicking, you will see a window appear at the bottom
3. Scroll to the bottom of the menu, and click on the ‘Join Channel’ button
4. To join with the camera, click on the camcorder icon

## Part 3: How to Stream on Discord from iPhone And Android

Although Discord does not allow users to broadcast content from the Discord Mobile app, they can still share their screen to stream games and videos. To do so, they must:

1. Select a voice channel and join it
2. Press the Video camera icon for screen-sharing
3. Then allow permission to third-party apps on the mobile to access your camera
4. Press the Camera icon to allow the program access to your camera
5. Once this is done, you are now streaming live

It is important to note that while sharing your screen on Discord, make sure you are not divulging any crucial details with other users in the form of notifications.

To avoid incoming notifications, put your mobile on airplane mode.

## Part 4: How to Watch Discord Streaming

Aside from broadcasting streams, you can also watch other users streaming their content on Discord. To watch someone’s stream, you will need to:

1. Go to the voice channel where someone is streaming and click on their name
2. If you’ve decided you want to join their stream, click on ‘Join Stream’
3. You can also click on ‘Watch Stream’ from the main chat screen on your Discord

When someone is streaming content on Discord, you can see a red ‘Live’ icon next to their name. Knowing this will make it easier to tell when your favorite users are streaming.

## Part 5: Discord Streaming Tips

To help you get the max out of your Discord streaming experience, we’ve compiled a couple of tips:

### Tip 1: How to Stream Without Lag On Discord

Do you experience lag while streaming games and videos on your Discord server? Don’t worry; streaming is often demanding for casual internet connections, and lags can happen!

Here are some quick fixes to get rid of it:

#### Close Unnecessary Programs

If you’re running multiple programs on your computer while using Discord, they can cause lag. To solve this, close all unnecessary programs.

#### Turn Off Hardware Acceleration

To do this:

1. Go to the ‘Settings’ option in your Discord app,
2. Click on ‘Appearance’ and toggle off the ‘Hardware Acceleration’ option
3. Press ‘OK’ to confirm and restart the application

#### Clear Discord Cache Files

Too many accumulated caches files can cause lag in your Discord. To fix this, you will need to clear the Discord cache from the File Explorer:

1. Open the ‘Run’ window
2. Enter _‘%APPDATA%/Discord/Cache’_ to open the cache folder
3. Press ‘Ctrl+A’ to delete the files

#### Reset Discord Voice Settings

To do this:

1. Go to the ‘Settings’ option on your Discord app
2. Select the ‘Voice & Video’ option in the left pane
3. Click on the ‘Reset Voice Settings’ in the right pane
4. Press OK to confirm and restart the application

#### Reinstall Discord

If none of the above methods seem to fix lag, you might have to reinstall your Discord. To uninstall it: first

1. Go to the Discord Panel,
2. Select ‘View by: Category’
3. Click ‘Uninstall a program’
4. Right-click Discord
5. Click Uninstall
6. After it is uninstalled, reinstall it once again

### Tip 2: How to Add A Game to Discord Go Live

If you can’t get access to the game you want to stream through the ‘Go Live’ icon, you can access it manually. All you have to do is:

1. Click on the cog icon in the bottom left
2. Open the Settings menu
3. Click on the ‘Game Activity’ tab on the left
4. Click ‘Add It’
5. Choose your game
6. Go back to your server
7. Click the ‘Go Live’ button
