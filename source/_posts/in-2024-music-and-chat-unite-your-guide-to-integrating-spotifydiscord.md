Discord is a communication software that allows users, mostly gamers, to communicate in real-time with clear lag-free voice chat and text chat and exchange information. It is available for free but requires you to buy Discord-Nitro to access more features.

## **Part 1: Why You Should Try A Discord Alternative?**

Although Discord is an amazing application and used by the majority of the player base, professionals and even by companies for corporate meetings. There are some points due to which one might prefer something different than what discord has to offer as its main focus is to provide ease for all kinds of gamers.

Here are some reasons that might cause you to look at other alternatives:

* Server Raids
* Less Free File Transfer Size
* Not So Professional UI
* Less Specific Profile Editing
* No Self Hosting
* And more.

## **Part 2: Best Discord Alternative Programs You Should Try**

There is a wide market of programs that can provide you the same features as Discord or features that aren’t in Discord but you need. Below is a list of programs that you can try to find perfect one for you.

### **Discord Alternatives Best For Gamer Chatting**

#### 1  TeamSpeak

TeamSpeak is a proprietary voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) application for audio communication between users on a voice channel, very almost like a call. Users typically use headphones with a microphone. It has been around since 2002 and hence is widely trusted by the community.

![discord alternative for gamers - teamspeak](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/teamspeak-audio-communication-app.jpg)

It allows crystal clear and lag free communication with 3D immersive features that help gamers who play real simulation games like Arma 3 to feel more involved with the radio feature and more. TeamSpeak is available on Window, Mac and on Mobile Devices.

Some of the advantages that TeamSpeak offers that make it better than the rest are:

* Spam Free
* Military Grade Encryption
* Host Private Servers
* Access over 100 add-ons, skins and voice packs
* Cloud-based service that enables you to synchronize your servers, settings, and preferences between devices with ease
* Won’t Provide Your Data to Third Parties
* 3D User Immersive Positioning

You can read more about it’s advantages at: <https://teamspeak.com/en/features/overview/>

#### 2 Mumble

Mumble is a voice IP application primarily designed to be employed by gamers and is analogous to programs like TeamSpeak. Mumble uses a client–server architecture which allows users to speak to each other via an equivalent server. It has a really simple administrative interface and features high sound quality and low latency. It has been around since 2005 but they released the stable version in October 2020.

![discord alternative for gamers - Mumble](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mumble-public-server-list.jpg)

Mumble is quite similar to TeamSpeak in it’s features and abilities. But in addition to that, it provides a large list of features separate to each kind of user from End-users to Hosters.

Users use Mumble for realism with their positional audio. This means that the farther one is, the more difficult it would be to receive their audio signals. And so Eve Online Players have servers with almost 100 active voice participants at a time. Mumbleis available on Window, Mac and on Mobile Devices.

Some more advantages that Mumble offers are:

* Low Latency - Great for Gaming
* Privacy - Always Encrypted Communication
* Open Source
* Extensive User Permission System (ACL)
* Free Software - No Licensing or Cost (even for Hosters)

![discord alternative for gamers - Ventrilo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ventrilo-interface.jpg)

Ventrilo is best known for its superior sound quality and minimal use of CPU resources so as to not interfere with normal operations of the pc or during online game competitions.
