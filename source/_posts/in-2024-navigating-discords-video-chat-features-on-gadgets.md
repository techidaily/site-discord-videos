Discord is a great place to hang out with like-minded people and just relax. But sometimes you want to do more than just chat using text messaging, which is where [video calling](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) comes in handy.

Discord has video call options built into the desktop app, the web browser and the mobile app, so you don’t need to switch between different software when you want to chat on video with your friends or colleagues. Read on to find out how to make a video call on Discord.

* [Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Make a Server Video Call on Discord?](#part3)
* [Part 4: FAQs about Discord Video Call](#part4)

## Part 1: Best Settings for Discord Video Call

Before you start calling everyone, you’ll want to check your settings to make sure you have the best experience. It’s important to make sure you’ve got your best equipment setup to work for the highest quality audio and video possible.

![Discord User Settings option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

So, start by heading to the User Settings page. You’ll find this at the bottom left of the screen – look for the cog icon next to your name. You won’t see this on mobile, this is only on the desktop app and the web browser version of Discord.

![Discord Video Call Settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-settings.jpg)

Once you’ve opened settings, you’ll want to click on the **Voice & Video** tab. Here you can check your microphone settings and adjust the volume, and choose your camera. If you’re using an external camera instead of the built-in option, check that the right one is selected in the dropdown.

You can also use this opportunity to run a test video – so that you know you’re well-lit, properly framed and otherwise good to go. You can adjust the lighting in your room or move the camera if you don’t feel it’s quite right.

One quick note for the web browser version of Discord – you’ll be asked to grant permission to your microphone and camera. Make sure you allow the site to use your equipment otherwise it won’t work on the video call.

Once you are happy, just click the close button at the top right of the settings options.

## Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?

Once you’ve got your settings ready, you’re set to make your private Discord video call. If you’re doing it on the web browser or desktop app, you’ll need to first navigate to the inbox you share with the person you want to call. Do this by clicking on the Home button at the top left – you’ll then get a list of all your contacts.

If you’re only calling one person then it’s easy – just click on their name.

![Discord Video Call with Friends ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-discord-friend.jpg)

If you want to call a private group, you need to click the + button and then create a group DM. Add the names of the users you want to call.

![Discord Video Call with group ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friend-group-video-call-discord.jpg)

Once you’re in the direct message window of the person or group you want to call, you need to look at the buttons at the top right of the screen. The second icon that looks like a video camera is the one you’re looking for. Click that and you’ll start a video call.

You’ll see yourself on screen at this point, but you’ll need to wait until the other person or group members have joined the call for the chat to properly begin.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Discord Video Call interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg)

The process of making video call on Discord mobile is essentially identical. You just need to open the direct message group and click on the video call icon, which is still at the top right of your screen.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Discord Video Call interface on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discrod-personal-video-call-mobile.jpg)

You’ll need to give permissions for the Discord mobile app to use your microphone and camera if you haven’t already.

Once you’ve finished your video call on either desktop or mobile, just hit the red button to end it and switch your camera off again.

## Part 3: How to Make a Server Video Call on Discord?

If you want to make a group video call on a public server, you again need to first navigate to the server. Once you’re there, you’ll need to join the voice channel that you should see on the left side of the screen.

Once you’re in the voice channel, click Lounge, Community Hangout or Stream Room, and then switch on your camera by clicking the ‘Video’ button. You’ll find this at the bottom-left of the screen. Again, if you’re on the web browser, you’ll be asked by your browser for permission to use your camera at this stage.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Discord Server Video Call  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-video-call.jpg)

And that’s it – the video call is now live and anyone who joins the voice channel will be able to see you, chat to you and switch on their camera to join the video conference as well.

On mobile, it’s slightly different. You’ll still want to head to the server you want to join and then click on the voice channel to join it. But as soon as you click on the voice channel, you’ll get a pop-up with an icon at the bottom right where you can instantly switch on your camera.

![Discord Server Video Call on mobile  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-video-call-mobile.jpg)

If you prefer, you can still just join as voice, and then at any stage click on your name where you’ll be able to then switch on your camera to turn a voice chat into a video call.

Whenever you want to end the video call, just click on your name again to switch off your camera, or disconnect completely from the voice channel.

## FAQs About Discord Video Chat Call

#### 1\. How Many People Can Join in the Discord Group Video Call?

Normally, the limit for the number of users on a group video call in Discord is 10\. However, during the Coronavirus pandemic, the team behind Discord know that it’s a valuable tool to help people stay connected. So the limit has been increased to 25 users. This may be reduced in the future once the world returns to some sense of normality.

#### 2\. How to Join a Video Call on Discord?

Joining an existing video call on Discord is a really easy process.

If it’s a private video call, you’ll get a pop-up in the chat window letting you know that a video call has been started. You have the option of declining the video call, joining it with video, or just joining with voice without your camera switched on.

If instead, it’s a public server where a video call is happening, you just need to join the voice channel by clicking on it on the left side of the screen, and then clicking on the video button next to your name, just as if you were starting the call in the first place.

You’ll need to give permissions for the Discord mobile app to use your microphone and camera if you haven’t already.

Once you’ve finished your video call on either desktop or mobile, just hit the red button to end it and switch your camera off again.

## Part 3: How to Make a Server Video Call on Discord?

If you want to make a group video call on a public server, you again need to first navigate to the server. Once you’re there, you’ll need to join the voice channel that you should see on the left side of the screen.

Once you’re in the voice channel, click Lounge, Community Hangout or Stream Room, and then switch on your camera by clicking the ‘Video’ button. You’ll find this at the bottom-left of the screen. Again, if you’re on the web browser, you’ll be asked by your browser for permission to use your camera at this stage.

![Discord Server Video Call  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-video-call.jpg)

And that’s it – the video call is now live and anyone who joins the voice channel will be able to see you, chat to you and switch on their camera to join the video conference as well.

On mobile, it’s slightly different. You’ll still want to head to the server you want to join and then click on the voice channel to join it. But as soon as you click on the voice channel, you’ll get a pop-up with an icon at the bottom right where you can instantly switch on your camera.

![Discord Server Video Call on mobile  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-video-call-mobile.jpg)

If you prefer, you can still just join as voice, and then at any stage click on your name where you’ll be able to then switch on your camera to turn a voice chat into a video call.

Whenever you want to end the video call, just click on your name again to switch off your camera, or disconnect completely from the voice channel.

## FAQs About Discord Video Chat Call

#### 1\. How Many People Can Join in the Discord Group Video Call?

Normally, the limit for the number of users on a group video call in Discord is 10\. However, during the Coronavirus pandemic, the team behind Discord know that it’s a valuable tool to help people stay connected. So the limit has been increased to 25 users. This may be reduced in the future once the world returns to some sense of normality.

#### 2\. How to Join a Video Call on Discord?

Joining an existing video call on Discord is a really easy process.

If it’s a private video call, you’ll get a pop-up in the chat window letting you know that a video call has been started. You have the option of declining the video call, joining it with video, or just joining with voice without your camera switched on.

If instead, it’s a public server where a video call is happening, you just need to join the voice channel by clicking on it on the left side of the screen, and then clicking on the video button next to your name, just as if you were starting the call in the first place.

## Part 1: Best Settings for Discord Video Call

Before you start calling everyone, you’ll want to check your settings to make sure you have the best experience. It’s important to make sure you’ve got your best equipment setup to work for the highest quality audio and video possible.

![Discord User Settings option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

So, start by heading to the User Settings page. You’ll find this at the bottom left of the screen – look for the cog icon next to your name. You won’t see this on mobile, this is only on the desktop app and the web browser version of Discord.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Discord Video Call Settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-settings.jpg)

Once you’ve opened settings, you’ll want to click on the **Voice & Video** tab. Here you can check your microphone settings and adjust the volume, and choose your camera. If you’re using an external camera instead of the built-in option, check that the right one is selected in the dropdown.

You can also use this opportunity to run a test video – so that you know you’re well-lit, properly framed and otherwise good to go. You can adjust the lighting in your room or move the camera if you don’t feel it’s quite right.

One quick note for the web browser version of Discord – you’ll be asked to grant permission to your microphone and camera. Make sure you allow the site to use your equipment otherwise it won’t work on the video call.

Once you are happy, just click the close button at the top right of the settings options.

## Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?

Once you’ve got your settings ready, you’re set to make your private Discord video call. If you’re doing it on the web browser or desktop app, you’ll need to first navigate to the inbox you share with the person you want to call. Do this by clicking on the Home button at the top left – you’ll then get a list of all your contacts.

If you’re only calling one person then it’s easy – just click on their name.

![Discord Video Call with Friends ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-discord-friend.jpg)

If you want to call a private group, you need to click the + button and then create a group DM. Add the names of the users you want to call.

![Discord Video Call with group ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friend-group-video-call-discord.jpg)

Once you’re in the direct message window of the person or group you want to call, you need to look at the buttons at the top right of the screen. The second icon that looks like a video camera is the one you’re looking for. Click that and you’ll start a video call.

You’ll see yourself on screen at this point, but you’ll need to wait until the other person or group members have joined the call for the chat to properly begin.

![Discord Video Call interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg)

The process of making video call on Discord mobile is essentially identical. You just need to open the direct message group and click on the video call icon, which is still at the top right of your screen.

![Discord Video Call interface on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discrod-personal-video-call-mobile.jpg)

You’ll need to give permissions for the Discord mobile app to use your microphone and camera if you haven’t already.

Hence, it’s a great platform for professionals, game lovers, and other individuals to communicate efficiently.
