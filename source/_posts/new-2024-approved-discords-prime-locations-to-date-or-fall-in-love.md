## Part 1: Discord Server Permissions You Can Set Up

To give you a heads-up, there are around 29 permissions that you can adjust over a Discord server. More specifically, there are 7 voice permissions, 9 permissions related to texts, and about 13 permissions dealing with the server.

this permission allows the user to reduce the volume of other users when this user is speaking so that their words are louder on the channel.

### 5\. Advanced permissions

Includes the 'Administrator' permission, which by default enables all the permissions to the assigned user.

## Part 2: How to Make and Add Roles in Discord on Computer

The desktop app and Browser resemble the mobile apple a lot. The process of assigning roles and configuring members is more or less the same across devices. First, you need to create roles and define their authority before assigning these roles to some members.

### How to create roles in Discord?

Before you can assign roles, you need a server. Once you have created your Discord server, start crafting the structure.

1. Open your server and right-click on it.
2. From the menu that appears, tap server settings.
3. Name the role suitably. It should be descriptive of the authority.
1. Tap on the plus sign that appears on the top right of the page.
2. Here, you can change the title off the roll and even choose the color.
3. Now comes the time to grant some permissions. These are basically the authority that you gave to every profile.
4. When you are done, save the changes.

### How to Assign Roles to Members in Discord?

To be able to assign roles, you should first create them

1. Once again, hit that right button on your server and go to server settings.
2. From the menu that appears to the left, ‘choose members’ under user management.
3. Here, you will see the list of all the members on your server, tap the Plus sign that is right beside the username.
4. From the drop-down menu that appears, select a role you want to assign to that member.
1. You will notice that the color changes as per your settings. And this is how you assign roles to a server.

## Part 3: How to Manage Roles in Discord?

After you learn **how to make roles in Discord**, you might want to manage them.

If you have got the hang of creating roles, then managing them is no different. Whenever the server gets crowded, you can create more roles or modify the existing ones. A smaller server can run smoothly with just an admin and an ‘everyone’ role.

The quickest and easiest way to manage your bloating server is to let all members be ‘everyone’ and adjust permissions accordingly. So, whenever members enter your server, they will automatically be assigned the common role.

Further, you can easily figure out what roles you have assigned to whom. Due to these colors, the other members can identify moderators, admins, or other roles.

## Part 4: How to Delete Roles in Discord?

Honestly, removing Discord roles easier than setting them up. There are hardly a few steps that you need to follow for role removal.

1. place the cursor on the server, and hit the right-click.
2. From the list, choose server settings. Then click on roles.
3. From the roles window, tap on the role that you wish to delete.
1. Towards the bottom, you will see the option to delete the role.
2. Press ok to confirm.

## Part 5: How to Add Roles on Discord Mobile?

Like we mentioned earlier, the user interface of Discord is similar across devices. So, there is little difference between the process of creating and managing roles. But it can be baffling for beginners, so here’s a brief!

### 1\. How to create roles in Discord mobile app?

Before you can assign roles, you have to create them.

* Open your server.
* Tap on the arrow beside the server’s title. A drop-down menu will appear. Select ‘server settings’ from that.
* Tap on 'Roles.' A common role, 'everyone' is assigned to all the members who have basic permissions enabled for everyone.
* Tap the plus sign and add a role.
* Give the role a color and describe it in a few words.
* Go through the permissions and enable the ones that fit the role.
* Save the changes.

You can repeat this multiple times to create more roles.

### 2\. How to Assign Roles in Discord mobile app?

* Head over to settings and select 'Members.'
* Select the members you want to assign roles to.
* Tick the boxes beside each member’s name for the roles you are assigning them.

Save the changes, and you are good to go! You can assign multiple roles to a member.

## Part 6: FAQs about Discord Server Roles

Just some obvious things you might wonder about.

1. How to make someone admin on Discord?

Making someone admin is the same as assigning other roles. Open your server and go to server settings.

* From there, select ‘roles’ from the left pane.
* Create a new role.
* Name the role ‘admin’ or an equivalent title.
* Adjust the setting related to sorting out role members with other members.
* Go to general permissions and tick the ‘Administrator’ option.
* Hit the ‘save changes’ button at the bottom.
* Now it's time to assign the role to someone. Right-click on the user that you want to assign the role.
* Choose 'roles' from the drop-down list and select 'Admin.'

And now your server has an admin!

1. How can I assign roles to new users in Discord automatically?

By default, every member gets the role of ‘everyone’ on the server. However, you can customize this and add the MEE6 bot for automatic role allocation.

1. Why can’t I manage the server even I am an admin on the server?

This is likely to happen if the server owner gave you the role of admin, but the permissions are disabled. You can ask the owner to enable the permissions for your user ID.
