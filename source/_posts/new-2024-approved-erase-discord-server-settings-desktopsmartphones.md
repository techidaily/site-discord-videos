Discord servers are made and designed to help gamers – and now work colleagues – communicate and coordinate via private rooms.

Most server owners choose to delete their Discord server when too many extra, strange, or ill-meaning visitors are visiting.

And lastly, ensure that this is what you intend on doing because deleting a Discord server is permanent. Here are the simple steps to follow on **how to delete a server on Discord**:

1. Open the Discord desktop app and click on the server you want to delete
2. Once you select the server, there will be an options list under the server's name
