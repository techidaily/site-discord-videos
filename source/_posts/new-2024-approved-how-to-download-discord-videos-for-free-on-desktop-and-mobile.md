If you want to download videos from the message threads on Discord on various OS platforms, and don’t know whether any specialized tool (Discord video downloader) is needed for this task, then you will find this article helpful. Since here is a comprehensive answer that you might find practically useful for downloading Discord video or other media.

## Part 1: How to Download Discord Videos on Desktop without Downloaders?

If you are accessing Discord from a desktop computer, the process of video downloading will be very similar to the procedure used in any other software suite. All you need to do is find the video you want to keep and right-click on it, then click on the arrow icon in the upper right corner (in-app).

![download videos  on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-discord-video.jpg)

This simple action will send the video directly to your computer hard drive, although you might have to wait a little bit until the transfer is completed.

The time needed for the download depends on the size of the video as well as the speed of your internet. After the download, you will be able to find the file in the default folder that you use for all online downloads, and you can play it from there or move it to a more permanent location, i.e. collection of funny videos.

As you can see, downloading discord videos to your desktop is extremely simple and straightforward regardless of how the video was created. Whether you are using a Discord Web or on Windows or Mac desktop, there is no need to use a Discord video downloader.

## Part 2: How to Download Videos of Mobile (Android and iPhone)

For users who log on to discord from a mobile phone, the procedure of downloading a video can be a bit more complicated than when using a PC.

First of all, the type of the operating system plays a role, so you need to pay attention to whether you are using Discord on Android or iOS.

Next, you need to check whether the video was posted through a third-party app such as YouTube for example. If it is, you need to follow the link and download the video from the original platform that is hosting it. You can check these [video downloader app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you may need.

Another possibility is to simply play the video and use a recording app to make a copy on your phone. Simply select a screen capture app on your iPhone or Android phones, play the video and start recording! Once you complete the recording, the video that looks identical to the original file you played on Discord will be saved to your device, allowing you to use it as you desire or share it with others on other platforms.

## Part 3: How to Download Videos from Discord Via Bots?

Discord Bots are automated modules that can be tasked with many different functions, and they represent a great way to customize your experience on this platform. They can be readily created from scratch or acquired from other users in already functional form.

While creating a new Bot specifically for video downloads can be demanding in terms of software development knowledge, there are a large number of various bots that can be used for this purpose and most of them are free to use! Discord Downloader Go made by get-got would be a nice try. Here is where you can get it: <https://github.com/get-got/discord-downloader-go>.

Before you try this option, try to read the detailed specification of the Bot and check whether it’s well suited for the type of action you need to perform (i.e. downloading embedded YouTube videos). If you do some research, it’s very likely that you will find a Bot that serves exactly the function you had in mind.

## Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions About Discord Video Download

Users also want to know about some other details related to multimedia downloads from the Discord platforms. We provided some answers to the most common dilemmas that new Discord members are struggling with:

#### Is It Safe to Download Files from Discord?

The question of security should always be taken seriously, so it’s reasonable to ask whether downloads from Discord carry any significant risks.

In general, security on Discord is comparable to standards that other major social networks adhere to, so in a typical case downloading a file is quite safe.

Still, like with any other internet-based transfer, it’s possible to run into a malicious file that could contain a virus or other malware. Examining multimedia files before downloading them (i.e. by watching the video online) and scanning them with anti-virus programs after receiving them are some of the steps that can be applied to prevent an accidental download of malware.

#### How can I download images and pictures on Discord?

The procedure for downloading still images from Discord chats is just as simple as the one for videos described above. All it takes to complete it is to find the image you want, right-click anywhere on it on the screen, and pick the ‘Save Image’ option.

![Save images on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-image-on-discord.jpg)

This action will result in the appearance of the desired image in your designated download folder, so this is the place where you should look for the file. Since most online pictures are in low resolution, the transfer should be completed nearly instantly even if you are using an older computer or a weak smartphone.

#### Can I Download Files Automatically on Discord?

Another useful option that many users inquire about is the automated download of multimedia files attached to Discord chats. This can be done very easily with help of dedicated third-party software tools such as Discord video downloader or similar products. You can try Discord Image Downloader Go made by Seklfreak on Github: <https://github.com/Seklfreak/discord-image-downloader-go>.

Using this simple program, you can specify which messages to scan and where to store any downloaded contents. Once this is set up, you will automatically receive all attachments from the selected Discord chats directly to your device, saving you the trouble to manually search for and download each file individually.

Here is a detailed video tutorial from Tom's Tutorials about how to download and set up the Discord Image Downloader Go to auto-download all pictures at once.

**Conclusion**

As we clearly demonstrated in this article, it’s possible to download Discord videos and share them elsewhere without too much effort or technical knowledge. In fact, the simplicity of media sharing is one of the main reasons why so many people are joining Discord in the first place.

Video downloads can be managed either directly (for PC users) or through external platforms and third-party products. In case you are not 100% satisfied with the default options provided by the platform, you could think about installing a Discord video downloader and setting it up to pick up all newly posted files even while you are not actively logged on to the platform. Such a tool can be very useful and make your experience on this communication app so much more fulfilling.

Either way, multimedia sharing and downloading on Discord won’t take long to get used to, after which you can start taking advantage of the full communication capacities at your disposal.

A **Discord banner** is best to customize your Discord account and make it more convincing. It allows you to improvise your profile icon with one of your favorite movies, games, memes, or anime characters. You can even decorate the space with your face.

Before looking at the steps to create a Discord profile banner, it’s crucial to note that only Nitro users can use this feature. You’ll have to settle for a limited list of 10-15 pre-made banners if you’ve not yet accessed the Nitro plan. These Discord banners feature solid colors and basic designs.

## **Part 1: Top 9 Discord Banner Makers in 2022 \[with free templates\]**

### 1. [Visme](http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/)

![discord banner maker visme](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-visme.jpg)

Visme offers 50 plus free channel art editable templates through their online graphics service. However, it has a bit more complex UI than some of the other makers on this list, but the free templates are wonderful, and you can upload your images to edit with them.

### 2. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html)

![fotor - discord banner maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fotor.jpg)

Another graphics program with free templates is Fotor. It is easy to use – perhaps the most accessible program on this list. You click on the element in your template and then click on what you want to replace it with, and thus you don't even have to use the drag and drop feature in the '**background’** tab. Of course, you can upload your photos as well.

There are subscription options in Fotor. Thus, you get a watermark for your project unless you pay for premium services, but there are enough free options to satisfy most creators.

### 3. [Snappa](https://snappa.com/create/youtube-channel-art)

![discord banner maker - snappa](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-snappa.jpg)

If you want to get something quick in design, Snappa is the right choice. First, choose one of the free templates under the **YouTube Channel Art under the Headers** tab. Then it’s just a matter of elements swapping in the template with ones that suit your channel.

Snappa shows you the ideal placement section for different devices while you edit.

### 4. [Crello](https://blog.crello.com/a-collection-of-free-youtube-channel-art-templates/)

![discord banner maker crello](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crello-highlight-cover-editing-interface.jpg)

Crello provides ten free examples of channel art templates through their blog, and you can rightly edit them on the site.

Crello is a simple visual editor designed for social media and marketing creators, meaning that non-design people can quickly jump into this platform. Beyond the free text options and templates, however, most of their backgrounds and stock photos cost $1\. You’re required to use the default images to use Crello for free or upload your own.

### 5. [Design Wizard](https://www.designwizard.com/)

![discord banner design wizard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-design-wizard.jpg)

This is another Discord banner maker with a few free templates to design or craft anything out through personalization. One of the best valuable abilities of the design wizard is that it will display the 'safe zone' – the area of your Discord banner that will show up on any device screen – so you can design keeping those dimensions in mind.

Also, make sure to delete the safe zone marker before you export.

### 6. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

![discord banner maker canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-montage.jpg)

Canva is one of the famous and free channel art makers. It is simple with a drag-and-drop editor. Also, the program will automatically resize images to adjust easily within the Discord banner space. It has a variety of free resources like stock photos. Some resources are paid ($1), but most of them are free.

### 7. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker)

While editing the Discord banner templates via Adobe Spark, click on the resources in the template and then select the images/fonts/etc., that you want to use. Resources like filters are also very accessible.

The only drawback of Spark is that the watermarks are in free downloads. However, the watermark is quite small, meaning that it won't show up for viewers as it is placed in the bottom-right corner watching your channel on either mobile devices or computers.

Note: Whenever you click 'Create your YouTube channel art,' it will show you a thumbnail template instead of a banner template. Hit the **Resize** button in the side menu and switch to your exported images or the channel art.

### 8. [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/)

![discord banner maker befunky](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-befunky.jpg)

This is a graphics creator platform that doubles as a Discord profile banner maker as well. You need to head towards BeFunky’s ‘**Designer**’ tool and look for the channel art templates under ‘**YouTube**’ and ‘**Social Media Headers**.’ However, we won’t find here any free art templates.

### 9. [Wondershare PixStudio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/)

![discord banner maker pixstudio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pixstudio-online-graphic-design-maker.jpg)

Wondershare PixStudio has certain unique features to erase the image background. With a single tap only, you can quickly remove the image background; then, you can use your image flexibly. And, it's just a subscription of $7.99 per month to use the features.

## Part 2: How to Create a Discord Banner with Kapwing

Since your server banner will take up an important place in your Discord server, you must make yours look just right. You have to consider the dimensions, formatting, and arrangement of the Discord profile banner.

* Use optimal dimensions
* Make sure the important parts are visible
* How to upload your banner image

#### Step 1: Use Optimal Dimensions

Discord recommends that your image have optimal dimensions of 960x540 at least, which is different than 16:9 images. You can use a slightly larger 16:9 aspect ratio for great appearances, like 1920x1080 or even 2560x1440.

With Kapwing Studio, you can crop any photo to a 16:9 aspect ratio and resize it to the given dimensions. Visit Kapwing.com in your browser, click **Start Editing**, and paste the link to a photo you found online or upload your image directly on the Studio.

Now, click the **Crop** tool to make your photo 16:9, and head towards the **Output Size** options to make your aspect ratio larger than 960x540.

#### Step 2: Make Sure the Important Parts Are Visible

This is the essential part of setting up your Discord banner – making sure your banner is properly visible on the Discord.

Your banner image's safe zone is that you should keep ideal sections out of the top 28% since that's where your server's options and name button will show.

The portion is a bit covered with text about the top 22% of your Discord banner photo. So, keep important sections and the text of your image below the top 120 pixels on a 960x540 Discord banner.

![kapwing discord banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/kapwing-discord-banner-1.jpg)

Now, you must note that the Discord profile banner will display as it starts fading about halfway down until merging in with the bottom-edge dark grey area of Discord.

And, you can smoothly edit any design elements, titles, text, or essential visuals at the bottom of the Discord profile banner. You should relocate them closer to the frame's center to be visible.

![make discord banner with kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/kapwing-discord-banner-2.jpg)

_Source: kapwing.com_

Hit the Crop button in the Kapwing Studio to add text boxes for banner personalization and horizontally flip your images to keep elements aside from the upper left corner. Hit the green Export Image button after you are over with cropping, then the Download button to save your banner to your device.

#### Step 3: Upload Your Banner Image

Adding a Discord profile banner is intuitive once your server boosts enough to reach level 2\. Just open your server dropdown menu and hit the **Server Settings**, then choose "**Upload Background**."

![discord banner server settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-server-settings.jpg)

Here, look for the image in your camera roll or files and upload it to your Discord channel server. It's that simple!

## Part 3: FAQs about Discord Banner

#### 1 - How do you make a banner on Discord?

You can consider various banner makers mentioned above to make a banner on Discord. However, you have to ensure compliance with Discord banner size requirements.

#### 2 - How do I get free Discord banners?

You can find free custom Discord Banner images already optimized and cropped for the Discord banner. Browse thousands of profile banners in categories like animated, meme, etc., on [pfps.gg website](https://pfps.gg/banners) to get free discord banners.

#### 3 – Can the Discord banner be GIF?

Yes, uploading a Discord banner in GIF format is allowed.

## Conclusion

The ability to set a Discord banner is part of the Discord update called "**Custom Profiles Premium**."

The feature is live on Discord, which means that everyone can modify or set Discord profile banners as per their likes and preferences. However, you must have access to Discord Nitro to change your profile banner. And, users who don't have Discord Nitro are not allowed to set a profile banner.

A **Discord banner** is best to customize your Discord account and make it more convincing. It allows you to improvise your profile icon with one of your favorite movies, games, memes, or anime characters. You can even decorate the space with your face.

Before looking at the steps to create a Discord profile banner, it’s crucial to note that only Nitro users can use this feature. You’ll have to settle for a limited list of 10-15 pre-made banners if you’ve not yet accessed the Nitro plan. These Discord banners feature solid colors and basic designs. What’s more, you can’t modify your banner for Discord on the Discord mobile apps. It’s only accessible via desktop versions.

In this article, we'll discuss the top 9 Discord banner makers, plus a helpful section on how to create your Discord banner.

## **Part 1: Top 9 Discord Banner Makers in 2022 \[with free templates\]**

### 1. [Visme](http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/)

![discord banner maker visme](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-visme.jpg)

Visme offers 50 plus free channel art editable templates through their online graphics service. However, it has a bit more complex UI than some of the other makers on this list, but the free templates are wonderful, and you can upload your images to edit with them.

### 2. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html)

![fotor - discord banner maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fotor.jpg)

Another graphics program with free templates is Fotor. It is easy to use – perhaps the most accessible program on this list. You click on the element in your template and then click on what you want to replace it with, and thus you don't even have to use the drag and drop feature in the '**background’** tab. Of course, you can upload your photos as well.

There are subscription options in Fotor. Thus, you get a watermark for your project unless you pay for premium services, but there are enough free options to satisfy most creators.

### 3. [Snappa](https://snappa.com/create/youtube-channel-art)

![discord banner maker - snappa](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-snappa.jpg)

If you want to get something quick in design, Snappa is the right choice. First, choose one of the free templates under the **YouTube Channel Art under the Headers** tab. Then it’s just a matter of elements swapping in the template with ones that suit your channel.

Snappa shows you the ideal placement section for different devices while you edit.

### 4. [Crello](https://blog.crello.com/a-collection-of-free-youtube-channel-art-templates/)

![discord banner maker crello](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crello-highlight-cover-editing-interface.jpg)

Crello provides ten free examples of channel art templates through their blog, and you can rightly edit them on the site.

Crello is a simple visual editor designed for social media and marketing creators, meaning that non-design people can quickly jump into this platform. Beyond the free text options and templates, however, most of their backgrounds and stock photos cost $1\. You’re required to use the default images to use Crello for free or upload your own.

### 5. [Design Wizard](https://www.designwizard.com/)

![discord banner design wizard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-design-wizard.jpg)

This is another Discord banner maker with a few free templates to design or craft anything out through personalization. One of the best valuable abilities of the design wizard is that it will display the 'safe zone' – the area of your Discord banner that will show up on any device screen – so you can design keeping those dimensions in mind.

Also, make sure to delete the safe zone marker before you export.

### 6. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

![discord banner maker canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-montage.jpg)

Canva is one of the famous and free channel art makers. It is simple with a drag-and-drop editor. Also, the program will automatically resize images to adjust easily within the Discord banner space. It has a variety of free resources like stock photos. Some resources are paid ($1), but most of them are free.

### 7. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker)

While editing the Discord banner templates via Adobe Spark, click on the resources in the template and then select the images/fonts/etc., that you want to use. Resources like filters are also very accessible.

The only drawback of Spark is that the watermarks are in free downloads. However, the watermark is quite small, meaning that it won't show up for viewers as it is placed in the bottom-right corner watching your channel on either mobile devices or computers.

Note: Whenever you click 'Create your YouTube channel art,' it will show you a thumbnail template instead of a banner template. Hit the **Resize** button in the side menu and switch to your exported images or the channel art.

### 8. [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/)

![discord banner maker befunky](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-befunky.jpg)

This is a graphics creator platform that doubles as a Discord profile banner maker as well. You need to head towards BeFunky’s ‘**Designer**’ tool and look for the channel art templates under ‘**YouTube**’ and ‘**Social Media Headers**.’ However, we won’t find here any free art templates.

### 9. [Wondershare PixStudio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/)

![discord banner maker pixstudio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pixstudio-online-graphic-design-maker.jpg)

Wondershare PixStudio has certain unique features to erase the image background. With a single tap only, you can quickly remove the image background; then, you can use your image flexibly. And, it's just a subscription of $7.99 per month to use the features.

## Part 2: How to Create a Discord Banner with Kapwing

Since your server banner will take up an important place in your Discord server, you must make yours look just right. You have to consider the dimensions, formatting, and arrangement of the Discord profile banner.

* Use optimal dimensions
* Make sure the important parts are visible
* How to upload your banner image

#### Step 1: Use Optimal Dimensions

Discord recommends that your image have optimal dimensions of 960x540 at least, which is different than 16:9 images. You can use a slightly larger 16:9 aspect ratio for great appearances, like 1920x1080 or even 2560x1440.

With Kapwing Studio, you can crop any photo to a 16:9 aspect ratio and resize it to the given dimensions. Visit Kapwing.com in your browser, click **Start Editing**, and paste the link to a photo you found online or upload your image directly on the Studio.

Now, click the **Crop** tool to make your photo 16:9, and head towards the **Output Size** options to make your aspect ratio larger than 960x540.

#### Step 2: Make Sure the Important Parts Are Visible

This is the essential part of setting up your Discord banner – making sure your banner is properly visible on the Discord.

Your banner image's safe zone is that you should keep ideal sections out of the top 28% since that's where your server's options and name button will show.

The portion is a bit covered with text about the top 22% of your Discord banner photo. So, keep important sections and the text of your image below the top 120 pixels on a 960x540 Discord banner.

Now, you must note that the Discord profile banner will display as it starts fading about halfway down until merging in with the bottom-edge dark grey area of Discord.

And, you can smoothly edit any design elements, titles, text, or essential visuals at the bottom of the Discord profile banner. You should relocate them closer to the frame's center to be visible.

![make discord banner with kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/kapwing-discord-banner-2.jpg)

_Source: kapwing.com_

Hit the Crop button in the Kapwing Studio to add text boxes for banner personalization and horizontally flip your images to keep elements aside from the upper left corner. Hit the green Export Image button after you are over with cropping, then the Download button to save your banner to your device.

#### Step 3: Upload Your Banner Image

Adding a Discord profile banner is intuitive once your server boosts enough to reach level 2\. Just open your server dropdown menu and hit the **Server Settings**, then choose "**Upload Background**."

![discord banner server settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-server-settings.jpg)

Here, look for the image in your camera roll or files and upload it to your Discord channel server. It's that simple!

## Part 3: FAQs about Discord Banner

#### 1 - How do you make a banner on Discord?

You can consider various banner makers mentioned above to make a banner on Discord. However, you have to ensure compliance with Discord banner size requirements.

#### 2 - How do I get free Discord banners?

You can find free custom Discord Banner images already optimized and cropped for the Discord banner. Browse thousands of profile banners in categories like animated, meme, etc., on [pfps.gg website](https://pfps.gg/banners) to get free discord banners.

#### 3 – Can the Discord banner be GIF?

Yes, uploading a Discord banner in GIF format is allowed.

## Conclusion

The ability to set a Discord banner is part of the Discord update called "**Custom Profiles Premium**."

The feature is live on Discord, which means that everyone can modify or set Discord profile banners as per their likes and preferences. However, you must have access to Discord Nitro to change your profile banner. And, users who don't have Discord Nitro are not allowed to set a profile banner.
