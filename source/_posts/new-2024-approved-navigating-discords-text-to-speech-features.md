While most users of the popular online messaging and content sharing site Discord rely on simple text to communicate, there are numerous situations when using the text-to-speech feature would be quite advantageous. This includes instances when there are language barriers or disabilities to overcome, but also spontaneous moments when users just enjoy hearing each other’s words.

In this article, we will discuss the specifics of activating the TTS function in Discord and using it effectively to improve your communication with other users. By following the detailed instructions provided here, you will be able to learn how to activate text-to-speech on Discord and manage your voice messages on selected servers in the most practical manner.

## Part 1: How to Enable Text-To-Speech Feature in Discord?

Before you can deploy TTS in your chats, you need to change the settings of your profile to enable this option. This isn’t hard to do – just go to the Discord app and select ‘Settings’ from the menu, which will trigger a pop-up window to appear on your screen. Next, you need to find the **Text & Images** section in the App Settings window, then scroll down to find the **Text-to-Speech** option, and finally tick the boxes next to **Allow playback and Usage of TTS** items. After you do this, your Discord will be ready to process your text messages in voice format.

![Discord Text to Speech Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-tts-command-discord-settings.jpg)

To test whether you successfully activated Text-to-Speech, open any chats on your personal server and try typing out a message, followed immediately by the tag /tts. If everything is working correctly, your message should appear on the screen in the text form, accompanied by its voice rendering delivered by an automated module. The timing of the two should be perfectly synchronized so that you hear the message and see the text at exactly the same instance. Otherwise, go back to settings and make sure you activated the TTS option properly or restart your Discord app.

## Part 2: How to Set Up Text-To-Speech Notifications on Discord?

Another practical possibility that can improve your Discord experience is to set up TTS notifications and be immediately informed whenever a fresh message arrives. This can also be done after you change the app parameters from the ‘Settings’ menu. After you see all options, choose ‘App Settings’ and search for the section named ‘Notifications’. By scrolling down, you will reach the item ‘Text-to-Speech notifications’ and after clicking on it you will be given a choice between three options.

![Discord Text to Speech Notification Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-text-to-speech-notification-settings.jpg)

The first option **For all channels** is to enable notifications on all channels on Discord; choosing it will result in a robotic voice reading all messages from all chats, regardless of whether they have a /tts tag. This option can be useful when you want to maximize your accessibility and receive important information instantly.

By picking the second option, **For current selected channel**, you can enable TTS notifications only on the current channel. This action will instruct Discord to have an automated voice read all the incoming messages on the active chat aloud, allowing you to stay in the loop at all times. This possibility works well for people who occasionally do multiple things at once, for example, gamers or streamers who use Discord to stay connected with their fans and friends while they are busy.

Finally, you can choose **Never** to hear any voice messages from your Discord chats never. If you pick this setting, even those messages that were sent with the /tts tag will only be displayed in the text format. This option provides you with peace of mind and prevents spammers from saturating you with voice messages you have no interest in hearing.

## Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech in Discord Chatting?

It’s not very hard to learn how to effectively use the TTS option in your chats on the Discord platform. This communication format is available on all channels that have an activated Text-to-Speech setting, so you can freely add a few messages to be read aloud or completely switch to automated voice format if you so desire. Doing this in practice is very simple – just start your message by typing the tag /tts and then enter your text as you normally would.

![Send  Discord Text to Speech Message](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/send-text-to-speech-tts-message-discord.jpg)

Your TTS message will be reproduced in a voice format by a Discord bot to all participants in the chat who didn’t mute incoming Text-to-Speech chats. An automated voice will say the entire message, and then also pronounce your username to identify the author. At the same time, the message will appear in the chat feed as plain text, so that even those recipients unable to hear it will be able to see the contents.

## Part 4: How to Mute All Text-To-Speech Messages on Discord?

You can also decide to prevent any messages from being played to you in a voice format and receive them as text only. This option is available even if you are not the administrator of the chat server and simply want to customize your own experience. To do this, you need to open the Discord app and enter the Settings menu, before selecting the Text & Images section from App Settings. After this, you need to find the Text-to-Speech sub-menu and open it to find the Allow Playback feature. If you disable this feature, you will effectively mute all incoming TTS messages across all Discord servers you are active on.

![Disable  Discord Text to Speech Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/disable-text-to-speech-tts-discord-settings.jpg)

Please keep in mind that deactivating the aforementioned feature won’t block TTS messages from reaching you, but you will see them as text only. On the other hand, you can’t use the /tts tag to send your own Text-to-Speech while the playback setting is disabled. Nothing is preventing you from turning it back on when you want to have a TTS capacity on Discord again.

## Part 5: Best Text-To-Speech Bots on Discord

One of the reasons why Discord is so popular is that it allows extensive customization through user-made Bots or modules that automatically perform a certain task. There are several great Bots that can be used for Text-to-Speech, so you might consider utilizing one of them.

### 1\. [Text to Speech (TTS)](https://top.gg/bot/527867442748194847)

With many languages supported and a wide range of cool commands, this bot could be the best choice for people who use TTS just for fun.

### 2\. [KD Bot](https://top.gg/bot/414925323197612032)

A very popular option for Text-to-Speech on Discord that lets you choose from more than 100 voices and supports upwards of 100 languages, making it a powerful translation tool.

### 3\. [Fergun](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/680507783359365121)

This multi-language tool responds to more than 100 different commands, so it can be used for a wide variety of purposes with stunning effectiveness.

### 2\. [KD Bot](https://top.gg/bot/414925323197612032)

A very popular option for Text-to-Speech on Discord that lets you choose from more than 100 voices and supports upwards of 100 languages, making it a powerful translation tool.

### 3\. [Fergun](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/680507783359365121)

## Choosing Between Slack & Discord for Enhanced Team Collaboration

# Slack Vs. Discord: Which Is Better for Your Team

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

[Discord](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)is popular among gamers as they use it to connect with team members, stream their play, and interact within the community.

Though, that is not to say that Discord is useless for non-gaming purposes.

[Slack](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)offers a pretty similar scope of use to Discord as a group chat application. However, it only caters to working individuals looking to liaison for projects and communicate effortlessly for work-related tasks.

Although they may be similar in a lot of ways, which is better for your needs? Let's compare them in detail and find out!

## Part 1: Discord Vs. Slack Pricing

Pricing is where Slack takes a hit. If you're low on budget, Discord is definitely a better option. Slack users must pay for a subscription, with the plans starting from $6.67 per month for simple features, such as removing the limit of 10,000 searchable messages and 10 integrations.

For extended features, such as guest access, 99.99% uptime, and 24/7 customer care, customers will have to shell out $12.5 per month.

In contrast, Discord offers **free access** to users with pretty much no limitations. Users can keep their team's message history in the free version and generally access most of the features.

However, if you want extra perks, such as higher screen sharing quality, extras space, or [animated emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can subscribe to the [Discord Nitro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) plan. **Slack vs. Discord has a clear winner if you're only considering the price point: Discord!**

![Discord Nitro Pricing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-pricing.jpg)

_Discord has a Nitro plan that provides unfiltered service, whereas it is still completely usable without it._

![Slack  Pricing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-pricing.jpg)

_Slack has various limits to features on three different levels_

## Part 2: Discord Vs. Slack Interface

Both apps share many similarities in their template and interface. Users will find their contacts on the left and conversations on the right on both apps.

However, Slack's interface is much more user-friendly and concise, with all the DMs, apps, and channels visible on the right.

In contrast, users might be initially thrown off by Discord due to its more complicated nature. If they want to access channels and direct messages, they will have to find them through different menus.

But compared to Slack, users will find it easier to customize their [Discord profile](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). They can add different theme colors and a light mode.

Slack's customization options also offer variety, but applying the changes can be quite cumbersome because of the complicated format. Discord is more intuitive when compared to Slack in terms of use.

Also, what you see as servers in Discord are essentially teams in Slack, and switching teams in Slack is more complicated than changing Discord servers.

![Discord interface   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-interface.jpg)

Lastly, when using Discord, you can join and leave servers at will, while you will have to go through an onboarding process for each team in Slack.

![Slack  interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-preferences-settings.jpg)

Slack vs. Discord is so hotly contested because of their similarities, and the interface is the biggest one of them all!

## Part 3: Discord Vs. Slack Conversations

Slack gives users the liberty to communicate in various ways, including direct messages, public conversations, and private channels.

In contrast, Discord channels only allow for communication using text and voice. Channel [members can be assigned specific roles,](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and users can also communicate via private channels.

Moreover, Slack does not have an official limit for team members, while Discord does have a server limit of 500,000 members.

If the number of online members exceeds 250,000, users need to contact Discord support for extra server space.

**Image**: _Discord (left) and Slack (right) also have a very similar way to send direct messages to various accounts_

## Part 4: Slack Vs. Discord Video Call

Discord is known for its [voice calls](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), allowing users to access special voice channels to just join and start speaking.

![Discord Video call   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg)

This feature is desirable to gamers who want to interact with friends in between games. Users can speak to 5,000 people simultaneously and see up to 9 friends at a time.

In contrast, Slack offers quite basic video calling features, missing out on crucial features like noise suspension and echo cancellation, which Discord offers.

Also, Discord offers a push-to-talk feature where users can turn their mics on during gaming sessions.

![Slack Video Conferencing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-video-conferencing.jpg)

_On Discord (left), the video call hub will drop down from the top, whereas, on Slack (left), the hub appears in the middle of the screen_

Both of these apps do not feature built-in voice messaging. Slack does offer the luxury of recording voice messages, but that requires third-party integration. Discord completely misses out on this feature.

If we were to rate the two apps for video calling features, **Discord seems to come out on top, offering many advanced features for its users.**

## Part 5: Discord Vs. Slack File Sharing

Users can share files on both Discord and Slack, with the size limit of files being the main difference.

With Discord, users can share files up to 8MB, but upgrading to the Nitro plan increases this limit to 15MB. In contrast, Slack allows users to share files up to 1GB.

However, Slack users cannot save these shared files forever, while Discord allows their users to save unlimited messages and file history.

This feature is handy if users need to access the files they shared in the past. They can also subscribe to the Nitro plan for longer backlogs and get a 50MB limit per file instead of the 8MB in the free version.

![Discord screensharing   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-screen-sharing-friends.jpg)

With Slack, users can even share Google Drive, along with code and text snippets, which is a valuable feature for business and work-related file-sharing.

In contrast, users can only share files from their own device on Discord. However, it is necessary to confirm before sharing files in both apps, which can be cumbersome for large file transfers.

![Slack screensharing   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-screen-sharing.jpg)

_The file-sharing prompt on Discord (left) and Slack (right) is also somewhat similar, with both providing instant sharing by holding down the Shift button_

## Part 6: Discord Vs. Slack Screen Sharing

Slack restricts video calls to two people, except for users who have subscribed to an extension plan. For paid users, the limit extends to 15 people.

It allows anyone to share their screen on a video call, regardless of their payment plan, and users can access both video and voice calls with the same button.

Discord also allows users to [share their screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with other members, giving them the luxury to share their entire screen, a particular window, or gameplay with up to 9 people at a time, without making any changes to the settings.

**Image**: _The screen sharing tools on Discord (Left) are more descriptive and provide more options than those for Slack (Left)_

## Part 7: Discord Vs. Slack Summary

When it comes to video calling and file-sharing, both apps can boast their qualities, catering to different target audiences and serving various purposes.

Discord prioritizes voice chat, where gamers can communicate with their friends while playing games. Slack is more business-centric as it emphasizes text chat, file transfers, and project collaboration, with a slightly more formal structure.

If you're looking for a more social-media-oriented network, where you can communicate with your peers easily in an informal manner, Discord is the right app for you. It is a dream for gamers, and now even for people collaborating at work!

However, if you're looking for an app that caters more to work-related purposes, with a large number of integrations, and a text-oriented layout, Slack will serve you well. It's an adequate team chat app for businesses and organizations.

At the end of the day, **Slack vs. Discord** is a fight whose victor is down to the user. What app you choose depends on your purpose and the goal you want to achieve.

And although Discord is well-placed to be the future of communications, as it stands, some gamers use Slack, and some businessmen use Discord. So, there's no saying that one app serves only one specific purpose.

However, Slack's interface is much more user-friendly and concise, with all the DMs, apps, and channels visible on the right.

In contrast, users might be initially thrown off by Discord due to its more complicated nature. If they want to access channels and direct messages, they will have to find them through different menus.

But compared to Slack, users will find it easier to customize their [Discord profile](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). They can add different theme colors and a light mode.

Slack's customization options also offer variety, but applying the changes can be quite cumbersome because of the complicated format. Discord is more intuitive when compared to Slack in terms of use.

Also, what you see as servers in Discord are essentially teams in Slack, and switching teams in Slack is more complicated than changing Discord servers.

![Discord interface   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-interface.jpg)

Lastly, when using Discord, you can join and leave servers at will, while you will have to go through an onboarding process for each team in Slack.

![Slack  interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-preferences-settings.jpg)

Slack vs. Discord is so hotly contested because of their similarities, and the interface is the biggest one of them all!

## Part 3: Discord Vs. Slack Conversations

Slack gives users the liberty to communicate in various ways, including direct messages, public conversations, and private channels.

In contrast, Discord channels only allow for communication using text and voice. Channel [members can be assigned specific roles,](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and users can also communicate via private channels.

Moreover, Slack does not have an official limit for team members, while Discord does have a server limit of 500,000 members.

If the number of online members exceeds 250,000, users need to contact Discord support for extra server space.

**Image**: _Discord (left) and Slack (right) also have a very similar way to send direct messages to various accounts_

## Part 4: Slack Vs. Discord Video Call

Discord is known for its [voice calls](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), allowing users to access special voice channels to just join and start speaking.

![Discord Video call   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg)

This feature is desirable to gamers who want to interact with friends in between games. Users can speak to 5,000 people simultaneously and see up to 9 friends at a time.

In contrast, Slack offers quite basic video calling features, missing out on crucial features like noise suspension and echo cancellation, which Discord offers.

Also, Discord offers a push-to-talk feature where users can turn their mics on during gaming sessions.

![Slack Video Conferencing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-video-conferencing.jpg)

_On Discord (left), the video call hub will drop down from the top, whereas, on Slack (left), the hub appears in the middle of the screen_

Both of these apps do not feature built-in voice messaging. Slack does offer the luxury of recording voice messages, but that requires third-party integration. Discord completely misses out on this feature.

If we were to rate the two apps for video calling features, **Discord seems to come out on top, offering many advanced features for its users.**

## Part 5: Discord Vs. Slack File Sharing

Users can share files on both Discord and Slack, with the size limit of files being the main difference.

With Discord, users can share files up to 8MB, but upgrading to the Nitro plan increases this limit to 15MB. In contrast, Slack allows users to share files up to 1GB.

However, Slack users cannot save these shared files forever, while Discord allows their users to save unlimited messages and file history.

This feature is handy if users need to access the files they shared in the past. They can also subscribe to the Nitro plan for longer backlogs and get a 50MB limit per file instead of the 8MB in the free version.

![Discord screensharing   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-screen-sharing-friends.jpg)

With Slack, users can even share Google Drive, along with code and text snippets, which is a valuable feature for business and work-related file-sharing.

In contrast, users can only share files from their own device on Discord. However, it is necessary to confirm before sharing files in both apps, which can be cumbersome for large file transfers.

![Slack screensharing   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-screen-sharing.jpg)

_The file-sharing prompt on Discord (left) and Slack (right) is also somewhat similar, with both providing instant sharing by holding down the Shift button_

## Part 6: Discord Vs. Slack Screen Sharing

Slack restricts video calls to two people, except for users who have subscribed to an extension plan. For paid users, the limit extends to 15 people.

It allows anyone to share their screen on a video call, regardless of their payment plan, and users can access both video and voice calls with the same button.

Discord also allows users to [share their screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with other members, giving them the luxury to share their entire screen, a particular window, or gameplay with up to 9 people at a time, without making any changes to the settings.

**Image**: _The screen sharing tools on Discord (Left) are more descriptive and provide more options than those for Slack (Left)_

## Part 7: Discord Vs. Slack Summary

When it comes to video calling and file-sharing, both apps can boast their qualities, catering to different target audiences and serving various purposes.

Discord prioritizes voice chat, where gamers can communicate with their friends while playing games. Slack is more business-centric as it emphasizes text chat, file transfers, and project collaboration, with a slightly more formal structure.

If you're looking for a more social-media-oriented network, where you can communicate with your peers easily in an informal manner, Discord is the right app for you. It is a dream for gamers, and now even for people collaborating at work!

However, if you're looking for an app that caters more to work-related purposes, with a large number of integrations, and a text-oriented layout, Slack will serve you well. It's an adequate team chat app for businesses and organizations.

At the end of the day, **Slack vs. Discord** is a fight whose victor is down to the user. What app you choose depends on your purpose and the goal you want to achieve.

And although Discord is well-placed to be the future of communications, as it stands, some gamers use Slack, and some businessmen use Discord. So, there's no saying that one app serves only one specific purpose.
