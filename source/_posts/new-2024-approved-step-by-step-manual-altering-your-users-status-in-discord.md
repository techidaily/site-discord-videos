## **Part 1: What Does the Discord Statuses Mean?**

Discord status is a changeable notification setting that enables users to set their current condition either AFK, online, or custom! This status consists of four options (online, Idle, Do not disturb, Invisible, and Custom) which will be explained below.

![default discord status options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/default-discord-status.jpg)

**Online:**

The default status of all Discord accounts is the Online mode! This mode allows you to receive instant notifications and show up in your contact list normally. It's indicated by a small green circle in your profile photo.

**Idle**:

The Idle mode is the same as the online status, though this status usually comes up automatically when you're away from the keyboard for a while, and it turns off as soon there's a movement within the Discord platform. In contrast, if the Idle status is set manually, you'll have to put it to online status yourself, and it's signified with a moon-shaped icon on your profile photo.

**Do not disturb:**

Do Not Disturb, also known as DND mode, disables all notifications from the Discord app, and it's indicated using a red status on your profile photo.

**Invisible:**

Invisible Mode allows you to use Discord while appearing Offline to other members, although the typing indicator will be displayed to your contact while typing. It's indicated with a gray icon on your profile.

**Custom:**

Custom status enables you to add messages that you want to be displayed on your profile. You can add up to a 128 character text limit, including emojis.

In contrast, if the Idle status is set manually, you'll have to put it to online status yourself, and it's signified with a moon-shaped icon on your profile photo.

**Do not disturb:**

Do Not Disturb, also known as DND mode, disables all notifications from the Discord app, and it's indicated using a red status on your profile photo.
