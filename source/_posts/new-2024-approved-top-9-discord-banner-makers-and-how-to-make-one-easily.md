A **Discord banner** is best to customize your Discord account and make it more convincing. It allows you to improvise your profile icon with one of your favorite movies, games, memes, or anime characters. You can even decorate the space with your face.

Before looking at the steps to create a Discord profile banner, it’s crucial to note that only Nitro users can use this feature. You’ll have to settle for a limited list of 10-15 pre-made banners if you’ve not yet accessed the Nitro plan. These Discord banners feature solid colors and basic designs. What’s more, you can’t modify your banner for Discord on the Discord mobile apps. It’s only accessible via desktop versions.

In this article, we'll discuss the top 9 Discord banner makers, plus a helpful section on how to create your Discord banner.

* [Part 2: How to Create a Discord Banner with Kapwing](#part2)
* [Part 3: FAQs about Discord Banner](#part3)

## **Part 1: Top 9 Discord Banner Makers in 2022 \[with free templates\]**

### 1. [Visme](http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/)

![discord banner maker visme](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-visme.jpg)

Visme offers 50 plus free channel art editable templates through their online graphics service. However, it has a bit more complex UI than some of the other makers on this list, but the free templates are wonderful, and you can upload your images to edit with them.

### 2. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html)

![fotor - discord banner maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fotor.jpg)

Another graphics program with free templates is Fotor. It is easy to use – perhaps the most accessible program on this list. You click on the element in your template and then click on what you want to replace it with, and thus you don't even have to use the drag and drop feature in the '**background’** tab. Of course, you can upload your photos as well.

There are subscription options in Fotor. Thus, you get a watermark for your project unless you pay for premium services, but there are enough free options to satisfy most creators.

### 3. [Snappa](https://snappa.com/create/youtube-channel-art)

![discord banner maker - snappa](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-snappa.jpg)

If you want to get something quick in design, Snappa is the right choice. First, choose one of the free templates under the **YouTube Channel Art under the Headers** tab. Then it’s just a matter of elements swapping in the template with ones that suit your channel.

Snappa shows you the ideal placement section for different devices while you edit.

### 4. [Crello](https://blog.crello.com/a-collection-of-free-youtube-channel-art-templates/)

![discord banner maker crello](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crello-highlight-cover-editing-interface.jpg)

Crello provides ten free examples of channel art templates through their blog, and you can rightly edit them on the site.

Crello is a simple visual editor designed for social media and marketing creators, meaning that non-design people can quickly jump into this platform. Beyond the free text options and templates, however, most of their backgrounds and stock photos cost $1\. You’re required to use the default images to use Crello for free or upload your own.

### 5. [Design Wizard](https://www.designwizard.com/)

![discord banner design wizard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-design-wizard.jpg)

This is another Discord banner maker with a few free templates to design or craft anything out through personalization. One of the best valuable abilities of the design wizard is that it will display the 'safe zone' – the area of your Discord banner that will show up on any device screen – so you can design keeping those dimensions in mind.

Also, make sure to delete the safe zone marker before you export.

### 6. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

![discord banner maker canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-montage.jpg)

Canva is one of the famous and free channel art makers. It is simple with a drag-and-drop editor. Also, the program will automatically resize images to adjust easily within the Discord banner space. It has a variety of free resources like stock photos. Some resources are paid ($1), but most of them are free.

### 7. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker)

While editing the Discord banner templates via Adobe Spark, click on the resources in the template and then select the images/fonts/etc., that you want to use. Resources like filters are also very accessible.

The only drawback of Spark is that the watermarks are in free downloads. However, the watermark is quite small, meaning that it won't show up for viewers as it is placed in the bottom-right corner watching your channel on either mobile devices or computers.

Note: Whenever you click 'Create your YouTube channel art,' it will show you a thumbnail template instead of a banner template. Hit the **Resize** button in the side menu and switch to your exported images or the channel art.

### 8. [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/)

![discord banner maker befunky](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-befunky.jpg)

This is a graphics creator platform that doubles as a Discord profile banner maker as well. You need to head towards BeFunky’s ‘**Designer**’ tool and look for the channel art templates under ‘**YouTube**’ and ‘**Social Media Headers**.’ However, we won’t find here any free art templates.

### 9. [Wondershare PixStudio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/)

![discord banner maker pixstudio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pixstudio-online-graphic-design-maker.jpg)

Wondershare PixStudio has certain unique features to erase the image background. With a single tap only, you can quickly remove the image background; then, you can use your image flexibly. And, it's just a subscription of $7.99 per month to use the features.

## Part 2: How to Create a Discord Banner with Kapwing

Since your server banner will take up an important place in your Discord server, you must make yours look just right. You have to consider the dimensions, formatting, and arrangement of the Discord profile banner.

* Use optimal dimensions
* Make sure the important parts are visible
* How to upload your banner image

#### Step 1: Use Optimal Dimensions

Discord recommends that your image have optimal dimensions of 960x540 at least, which is different than 16:9 images. You can use a slightly larger 16:9 aspect ratio for great appearances, like 1920x1080 or even 2560x1440.

With Kapwing Studio, you can crop any photo to a 16:9 aspect ratio and resize it to the given dimensions. Visit Kapwing.com in your browser, click **Start Editing**, and paste the link to a photo you found online or upload your image directly on the Studio.

Now, click the **Crop** tool to make your photo 16:9, and head towards the **Output Size** options to make your aspect ratio larger than 960x540.

#### Step 2: Make Sure the Important Parts Are Visible

This is the essential part of setting up your Discord banner – making sure your banner is properly visible on the Discord.

Your banner image's safe zone is that you should keep ideal sections out of the top 28% since that's where your server's options and name button will show.

The portion is a bit covered with text about the top 22% of your Discord banner photo. So, keep important sections and the text of your image below the top 120 pixels on a 960x540 Discord banner.

![kapwing discord banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/kapwing-discord-banner-1.jpg)

Now, you must note that the Discord profile banner will display as it starts fading about halfway down until merging in with the bottom-edge dark grey area of Discord.

And, you can smoothly edit any design elements, titles, text, or essential visuals at the bottom of the Discord profile banner. You should relocate them closer to the frame's center to be visible.

![make discord banner with kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/kapwing-discord-banner-2.jpg)

_Source: kapwing.com_

Hit the Crop button in the Kapwing Studio to add text boxes for banner personalization and horizontally flip your images to keep elements aside from the upper left corner. Hit the green Export Image button after you are over with cropping, then the Download button to save your banner to your device.

#### Step 3: Upload Your Banner Image

Adding a Discord profile banner is intuitive once your server boosts enough to reach level 2\. Just open your server dropdown menu and hit the **Server Settings**, then choose "**Upload Background**."

![discord banner server settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-server-settings.jpg)

Here, look for the image in your camera roll or files and upload it to your Discord channel server. It's that simple!

## Part 3: FAQs about Discord Banner

#### 1 - How do you make a banner on Discord?

You can consider various banner makers mentioned above to make a banner on Discord. However, you have to ensure compliance with Discord banner size requirements.

#### 2 - How do I get free Discord banners?

You can find free custom Discord Banner images already optimized and cropped for the Discord banner. Browse thousands of profile banners in categories like animated, meme, etc., on [pfps.gg website](https://pfps.gg/banners) to get free discord banners.

#### 3 – Can the Discord banner be GIF?

Yes, uploading a Discord banner in GIF format is allowed.

## Conclusion

The ability to set a Discord banner is part of the Discord update called "**Custom Profiles Premium**."

The feature is live on Discord, which means that everyone can modify or set Discord profile banners as per their likes and preferences. However, you must have access to Discord Nitro to change your profile banner. And, users who don't have Discord Nitro are not allowed to set a profile banner.

A **Discord banner** is best to customize your Discord account and make it more convincing. It allows you to improvise your profile icon with one of your favorite movies, games, memes, or anime characters. You can even decorate the space with your face.

Before looking at the steps to create a Discord profile banner, it’s crucial to note that only Nitro users can use this feature. You’ll have to settle for a limited list of 10-15 pre-made banners if you’ve not yet accessed the Nitro plan. These Discord banners feature solid colors and basic designs. What’s more, you can’t modify your banner for Discord on the Discord mobile apps. It’s only accessible via desktop versions.

In this article, we'll discuss the top 9 Discord banner makers, plus a helpful section on how to create your Discord banner.

* [Part 1: Top 9 Discord Banner Makers in 2022 \[with free templates\]](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Create a Discord Banner with Kapwing](#part2)
* [Part 3: FAQs about Discord Banner](#part3)

## **Part 1: Top 9 Discord Banner Makers in 2022 \[with free templates\]**

### 1. [Visme](http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/)

![discord banner maker visme](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-visme.jpg)

Visme offers 50 plus free channel art editable templates through their online graphics service. However, it has a bit more complex UI than some of the other makers on this list, but the free templates are wonderful, and you can upload your images to edit with them.

### 2. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html)

![fotor - discord banner maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fotor.jpg)

Another graphics program with free templates is Fotor. It is easy to use – perhaps the most accessible program on this list. You click on the element in your template and then click on what you want to replace it with, and thus you don't even have to use the drag and drop feature in the '**background’** tab. Of course, you can upload your photos as well.

There are subscription options in Fotor. Thus, you get a watermark for your project unless you pay for premium services, but there are enough free options to satisfy most creators.

### 3. [Snappa](https://snappa.com/create/youtube-channel-art)

![discord banner maker - snappa](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-snappa.jpg)

If you want to get something quick in design, Snappa is the right choice. First, choose one of the free templates under the **YouTube Channel Art under the Headers** tab. Then it’s just a matter of elements swapping in the template with ones that suit your channel.

Snappa shows you the ideal placement section for different devices while you edit.

### 4. [Crello](https://blog.crello.com/a-collection-of-free-youtube-channel-art-templates/)

![discord banner maker crello](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crello-highlight-cover-editing-interface.jpg)

Crello provides ten free examples of channel art templates through their blog, and you can rightly edit them on the site.

Crello is a simple visual editor designed for social media and marketing creators, meaning that non-design people can quickly jump into this platform. Beyond the free text options and templates, however, most of their backgrounds and stock photos cost $1\. You’re required to use the default images to use Crello for free or upload your own.

### 5. [Design Wizard](https://www.designwizard.com/)

![discord banner design wizard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-design-wizard.jpg)

This is another Discord banner maker with a few free templates to design or craft anything out through personalization. One of the best valuable abilities of the design wizard is that it will display the 'safe zone' – the area of your Discord banner that will show up on any device screen – so you can design keeping those dimensions in mind.

Also, make sure to delete the safe zone marker before you export.

### 6. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

![discord banner maker canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-montage.jpg)

Canva is one of the famous and free channel art makers. It is simple with a drag-and-drop editor. Also, the program will automatically resize images to adjust easily within the Discord banner space. It has a variety of free resources like stock photos. Some resources are paid ($1), but most of them are free.

### 7. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker)

While editing the Discord banner templates via Adobe Spark, click on the resources in the template and then select the images/fonts/etc., that you want to use. Resources like filters are also very accessible.

The only drawback of Spark is that the watermarks are in free downloads. However, the watermark is quite small, meaning that it won't show up for viewers as it is placed in the bottom-right corner watching your channel on either mobile devices or computers.

Note: Whenever you click 'Create your YouTube channel art,' it will show you a thumbnail template instead of a banner template. Hit the **Resize** button in the side menu and switch to your exported images or the channel art.

### 8. [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/)

![discord banner maker befunky](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-befunky.jpg)

This is a graphics creator platform that doubles as a Discord profile banner maker as well. You need to head towards BeFunky’s ‘**Designer**’ tool and look for the channel art templates under ‘**YouTube**’ and ‘**Social Media Headers**.’ However, we won’t find here any free art templates.

### 9. [Wondershare PixStudio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/)

![discord banner maker pixstudio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pixstudio-online-graphic-design-maker.jpg)

Wondershare PixStudio has certain unique features to erase the image background. With a single tap only, you can quickly remove the image background; then, you can use your image flexibly. And, it's just a subscription of $7.99 per month to use the features.

## Part 2: How to Create a Discord Banner with Kapwing

Since your server banner will take up an important place in your Discord server, you must make yours look just right. You have to consider the dimensions, formatting, and arrangement of the Discord profile banner.

* Use optimal dimensions
* Make sure the important parts are visible
* How to upload your banner image

#### Step 1: Use Optimal Dimensions

Discord recommends that your image have optimal dimensions of 960x540 at least, which is different than 16:9 images. You can use a slightly larger 16:9 aspect ratio for great appearances, like 1920x1080 or even 2560x1440.

With Kapwing Studio, you can crop any photo to a 16:9 aspect ratio and resize it to the given dimensions. Visit Kapwing.com in your browser, click **Start Editing**, and paste the link to a photo you found online or upload your image directly on the Studio.

Now, click the **Crop** tool to make your photo 16:9, and head towards the **Output Size** options to make your aspect ratio larger than 960x540.

#### Step 2: Make Sure the Important Parts Are Visible

This is the essential part of setting up your Discord banner – making sure your banner is properly visible on the Discord.

Your banner image's safe zone is that you should keep ideal sections out of the top 28% since that's where your server's options and name button will show.

The portion is a bit covered with text about the top 22% of your Discord banner photo. So, keep important sections and the text of your image below the top 120 pixels on a 960x540 Discord banner.

![kapwing discord banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/kapwing-discord-banner-1.jpg)

_Source: kapwing.com_

Now, you must note that the Discord profile banner will display as it starts fading about halfway down until merging in with the bottom-edge dark grey area of Discord.

And, you can smoothly edit any design elements, titles, text, or essential visuals at the bottom of the Discord profile banner. You should relocate them closer to the frame's center to be visible.

![make discord banner with kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/kapwing-discord-banner-2.jpg)

_Source: kapwing.com_

Hit the Crop button in the Kapwing Studio to add text boxes for banner personalization and horizontally flip your images to keep elements aside from the upper left corner. Hit the green Export Image button after you are over with cropping, then the Download button to save your banner to your device.

#### Step 3: Upload Your Banner Image

Adding a Discord profile banner is intuitive once your server boosts enough to reach level 2\. Just open your server dropdown menu and hit the **Server Settings**, then choose "**Upload Background**."

![discord banner server settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-server-settings.jpg)

Here, look for the image in your camera roll or files and upload it to your Discord channel server. It's that simple!

## How to Find Discord Server

Discord started out as a place for Gamers to hang out and play together online. Soon, it became a popular chat forum for people who obsess over music, movies, art, and anime fans.

Initially, Discord served as a voice channel for Gamers. However, today it is much more than that. It has bots, streaming features, voice channels, and many more personalization tools that make your server an intimate Hangout.

Using Discord without joining a server is as good as not using Discord at all. But if you are a newbie, you might find it difficult to join a server with active users. Not all servers are good, and this guide will help you filter out the best servers on Discord.

## Part 1: How to Find Discord Server on Explore Public Servers tab

The obvious questions that you will encounter after signing up on Discord are - **How to find a Discord server**? Is it difficult? Do I have to fill up an application?

One of the popular and easiest ways to find servers is to use explore Public Servers function. Here is a brief rundown of the steps -

1. Open the Discord app on your desktop visit the site.
2. Tap the compass symbol to open the explore public service option.
1. You will be directed towards the official Discord server directory. It has a search box on the top. Many top servers are listed below. Popular games like Minecraft, Fortnite, Call of Duty, and more are listed. You can tap open any of these channels to explore the community.

![Find Discord Server   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-community-on-discord-explore-public-server.jpg)

1. Likewise, you can enter some search terms in a search box and explore the channels related to the term. For instance, you can input the term 'Disney Movies' or 'Call of Duty' and hit the search button. And a list of servers dedicated to the terms will appear.
2. After exploring Discord servers, you might stumble upon a channel that you like. All you have to do is tab the join button.
3. To return to the directory, tap the compass.
4. Another way to hunt for the right servers is to explore the categories in the left side menu. The most common categories listed are - Gaming, Entertainment, Music, Art, and a few more.

## Part 2: Finding best Discord Server via Online Discord Website Directories

Another quick and easy way to find legit Discord servers is to explore the online directories dedicated to Discord servers.

Some of the popular channel directories are -

1. [Discord.me](http://discord.me/)

![Find Discord Server  via Discord.me ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discordme-bot-find-server.jpg)

You will fall in love with the appearance and user interface of Discord.me. The directory offers more than a thousand Discord servers. And a good number of them are legit. The ‘Categories’ drop-down list has a huge number of categories that people generally look for. You can also look for random servers and bots. The huge search bar at the top helps you explore the channels related to your search queries. Just below the search bar, the top channel categories are listed. If you scroll even further down, top servers are displayed. You can even look at the ones that have seen a recent surge in members and the ones that have mature content.

1. [disboard.org](http://discord.org/)

![Find Discord Server via  disboard.org ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discover-discord-servers-disboard.jpg)

This is the biggest directory that features servers sprawl across various subjects like languages, music, politics, LGBTQ, and several more alongside the usual gaming channels. You can use the search bar to hunt for servers related to your tastes. If you are baffled about where to start, you can explore the categories and tags underneath the search bar.

If you keep scrolling, you will come across popular channels or channels that have witnessed a sudden spike. On the disboard site, you can also read reviews about servers before joining them. You can also sort the servers according to your location.

1. [Discordservers.com](http://discordservers.com/)

![Find Discord Server via  Discordservers.com ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-discord-server-via-discordservers-bot.jpg)

This directory houses a vast collection of servers that are dedicated gaming community and geekdom. Upon entering the site, you will immediately notice that it has a sleek and minimal interface. You can easily navigate and find what you are looking for. The landing page has a list of featured channels. On the top, there is a search bar that can assist you in finding the servers related to your interests. However, you can hit the ‘browse’ button beside the search bar to explore all the categories.

After exploring the servers, you can pick a handful and have a glance at the servers before you decide to join in. You can scroll endlessly until you find a suitable channel for yourself. You can join multiple channels too.

## Part 3: How to Find Private Discord Server

Along with Public Servers that can be joined just with a click, there are many private servers. These servers can be entered only by invitation. The server's creator can send the invitations to you, or you will find the links on Twitter, Facebook, or other platforms.

The obvious questions that you will encounter after signing up on Discord are - **How to find Discord server**? Is it difficult? Do I have to fill up an application?

Unlike public servers, private servers have 50 to 500 members. They are not as active as the open ones, but they might be more dedicated to a specific community. Open servers are often more active, but they are "general." In case you want a more personal space with a few people, you might consider joining a private server.

Looking for a private server is a lot easier on platforms like Reddit. Here, you may find a link that leads to a private server. When you click on it, you will be directed to a landing page. Once you tap on the 'Accept Invite,' you will get into the private server.

Some servers require you to follow certain guidelines. If you don't comply, you will get a warning message from the mod or the bot. In worse scenarios, you might be kicked out. Further, some channels will prompt you to text the mod before you are allowed to enter. This is **how to find a** **Discord server that is private**.

Further, you can create your own server and invite your friends or your gaming clan to it. A server can be a personal space where you can talk to your friends via voice channels, stream games together, chat, share memes, listen to music, and add bots!

## Part 4: Find Discord Servers to Join Via other Platforms

Like we discussed above, Reddit is one of the places to find private Discord servers. Similarly, pages and communities on Facebook, Twitch, YouTube, and others might also link out to their Discord servers.

Further, influencers, series, movies may have a dedicated Discord server. Even blogs and websites can have a channel for their followers. Several gaming companies have a Discord channel for sharing tips with fans and for updates.

Several game streamers that stream on Twitch or Mixer have their own server where they update their followers. If you follow them, you can join their channel. The same goes for YouTubers and other gamers. Even tech-geek blogs and vlogs have a Discord server.

At the same time, people interested in business, the stock market, and investment have channels of their own. You can even find servers made by some musicians, artists, manga fans, anime fans, and more such communities.

Whenever you visit your favorite site, blog, or YouTube channel the next time, look if they have a Discord channel!

## Part 3: How to Find Private Discord Server

Along with Public Servers that can be joined just with a click, there are many private servers. These servers can be entered only by invitation. The server's creator can send the invitations to you, or you will find the links on Twitter, Facebook, or other platforms.

The obvious questions that you will encounter after signing up on Discord are - **How to find Discord server**? Is it difficult? Do I have to fill up an application?

Unlike public servers, private servers have 50 to 500 members. They are not as active as the open ones, but they might be more dedicated to a specific community. Open servers are often more active, but they are "general." In case you want a more personal space with a few people, you might consider joining a private server.

Looking for a private server is a lot easier on platforms like Reddit. Here, you may find a link that leads to a private server. When you click on it, you will be directed to a landing page. Once you tap on the 'Accept Invite,' you will get into the private server.

Some servers require you to follow certain guidelines. If you don't comply, you will get a warning message from the mod or the bot. In worse scenarios, you might be kicked out. Further, some channels will prompt you to text the mod before you are allowed to enter. This is **how to find a** **Discord server that is private**.

Further, you can create your own server and invite your friends or your gaming clan to it. A server can be a personal space where you can talk to your friends via voice channels, stream games together, chat, share memes, listen to music, and add bots!

## Part 4: Find Discord Servers to Join Via other Platforms

Like we discussed above, Reddit is one of the places to find private Discord servers. Similarly, pages and communities on Facebook, Twitch, YouTube, and others might also link out to their Discord servers.

Further, influencers, series, movies may have a dedicated Discord server. Even blogs and websites can have a channel for their followers. Several gaming companies have a Discord channel for sharing tips with fans and for updates.

Several game streamers that stream on Twitch or Mixer have their own server where they update their followers. If you follow them, you can join their channel. The same goes for YouTubers and other gamers. Even tech-geek blogs and vlogs have a Discord server.

At the same time, people interested in business, the stock market, and investment have channels of their own. You can even find servers made by some musicians, artists, manga fans, anime fans, and more such communities.

Whenever you visit your favorite site, blog, or YouTube channel the next time, look if they have a Discord channel!

## How to Find Discord Server

Discord started out as a place for Gamers to hang out and play together online. Soon, it became a popular chat forum for people who obsess over music, movies, art, and anime fans.

Initially, Discord served as a voice channel for Gamers. However, today it is much more than that. It has bots, streaming features, voice channels, and many more personalization tools that make your server an intimate Hangout.

Using Discord without joining a server is as good as not using Discord at all. But if you are a newbie, you might find it difficult to join a server with active users. Not all servers are good, and this guide will help you filter out the best servers on Discord.
