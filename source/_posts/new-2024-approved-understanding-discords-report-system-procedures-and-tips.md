 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord has completely transformed online communication, becoming the preferred platform for gamers, streamers, and reviewers alike.

As of late, it has started integrating with other gaming and streaming services, giving us the streamer mode. With streaming's growing popularity, it's essential to know what the streamer mode is all about.

If you're a gamer, Discord's streamer mode allows you to stream your gaming session to viewers by broadcasting your game to your friends, fans, and even a closed community of enthusiasts.

Many e-gaming professionals have taken up streaming, offering original and valuable content for like-minded individuals. This mode helps them streamline all their communications in one place.

If you're new to Discord’s streamer mode, you need to know what it is, how you can use it to engage with other community members, and the primary security concerns you need to be aware of.

* [Part 2: How to Report Users on Discord Mobile App?](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Kick People on Discord?](#part3)
* [Part 4: FAQs About Discord Reporting](#part4)

For gamers in the modern era, Discord is a household name. The platform has around 120 million active users monthly as of early 2021.

With so many users on the forum, it is normal to have some "bad apples" in the mix. There are trolls, miscreants, and spammers who ruin the experience for everyone else.

You can report them to Discord Trust and Safety team. They would take appropriate action against these nuisances after reviewing evidence.

Reporting helps make healthier communities and allows you to avoid conflicts and outbreaks due to suspicious activity on the platform.

Today we will look into how to report someone on Discord using desktop and mobile devices. Moreover, we will look at other ways to deal with indecent behavior, such as kicking people or banning them.

## Part 1: How to Report Users on Discord Desktop

Before you can report a person to Discord's Trust and Safety team, you will need to enable Discord's developer mode.

Enabling this mode will allow you to obtain the information necessary to file your report.

1. Login to your Discord account on PC or Mac
2. You will see a gear icon next to your username to the bottom left of your screen; click on it

![ Discord User Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

1. There will be a list of options in the sidebar; from here, click on "Appearance"
2. Next, scroll down until you find "Developer Mode" under Advanced; turn it on

![ Turn on Discord Developer Mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-discord-developer-mode.jpg)

After enabling developer mode, you will now need the user ID of the person you are reporting. To get someone's user ID:

1. Right-click on their username
2. From the list of options that appear, choose "Copy ID"
3. Paste this user ID somewhere so that you can access it later

To report a specific message, you need to get the message link as well. For this:

1. Locate the message you want to report
2. Then hover your cursor over it and click on the ellipsis sign (…) on the right side
3. Click on "Copy Message Link"
4. Paste this somewhere so that you can use it later

After collecting the necessary information, go to Discord's website to report it to [Discord's Trust and Safety Team](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket%5Fform%5Fid=360000029731).

You will have to provide your email address and post the two links copied earlier into the description box.

Also, it would help if you gave context regarding your report describing how and what rule was broken. You can also provide any other evidence you may want to present by attaching files in the attachments area.

![ Submit report request on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/submit-discord-user-report-request.jpg)

Now, confirm that you are a human by completing the captcha and then click on "Submit." Discord will contact you via email if action is taken against your complaint.

## Part 2: How to Report Users on Discord on iPhone And Android

Just like on a desktop, you will first need to enable developer mode.

1. After opening Discord on your mobile device, go to user settings by tapping on the gear icon or your profile picture next to your username
2. On iPhone, tap on "Appearance" and then go to "Advanced," whereas on Android, go to "App Settings" and tap "Behavior"

![  report people on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/report-user-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Turn on developer mode by clicking on the slider under the "Chat Behavior" option

Like before, you will now need to obtain the User ID; the process may be slightly different depending on the phone you are using. In general, the steps would be:

1. Open the user's profile by tapping on it
2. Tap on the ellipsis sign (…) in the upper-right of your screen and select "Copy ID"
3. After doing this, paste the ID somewhere you can later access

Follow the steps below to get the message link to report.

1. Go to the message and then hold down on it until a list of options appears
2. On an iPhone, tap on "Copy Message Link." For an android device, click on "Select" and then "Copy To Clipboard"

Now, you can send this information to the [Trust and Safety team](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket%5Fform%5Fid=360000029731) to assess it. To do this:

1. Paste the two links copied earlier in the "Description Box"
2. Provide your email address along with the context behind the situation
3. Click on "Submit"

## Part 3: How to Kick People on Discord

Discord also allows you to take care of improper behavior yourself. If you are a moderator or server owner, you can kick people for violating Discord's guidelines.

However, it is essential to have a reason to kick someone. Otherwise, it may be seen as an abuse of power.

Here are activities to look out for before kicking someone:

* Spam messages
* Harassment
* Sharing child pornography
* Violating IP rights
* Sharing viruses
* Advocating self-harm or suicide
* Distributing gore content or animal cruelty
* Life threats to another user

If you see someone involved in these, you can kick them off your server or report them to moderators or server owners if you don't have kicking authority.

In case the moderators or owners do not act on your complaint, you can always contact the Trust and Safety team.

If you happen to be a moderator or server owner, you have the authority to kick people off your server. Here is how to do it:

1. Go to the correct channel on Discord
2. Find the user from the user list on the right side of the screen
3. Right-click on their username and then select "Kick"
4. Click on "Kick" again to confirm your decision

## Part 4: FAQs About Discord Reporting

There is no need to Google responses to "How do you report someone on Discord," we have answers to the most frequently asked questions:

### Can I Report People on Discord Anonymously?

According to a [moderator on Discord's subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/ave1x3/are%5Freports%5Fanonymous/), information regarding a reported case remains between the T&S team and the reporter. Nothing regarding the complaint is shared with the individual kicked.

### What Happens If I Report Someone on Discord?

After you report someone on Discord, the T&S team goes through the evidence to justify or negate your claims.

Usually, this process takes a long time as the team evaluates whether the problem is part of a broader pattern.

After conducting their research and deciding upon a punishment, the T&S team will contact the offender via email to inform them about their misconduct and the relevant consequences.

In minor offenses, the T&S team will reach out to the reporter and teach them how to block the user rather than take direct action.

### Can You Report Someone on Discord for Being Under 13?

Individuals under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Discord unless they have permission from a parent or guardian. However, it is not very easy to prove that the user is below a certain age.

If you know someone who is undoubtedly underage, then you can report them to the Trust & Safety team by filling out their form and adding evidence to back your claim.

## Part 3: How to Kick People on Discord

Discord also allows you to take care of improper behavior yourself. If you are a moderator or server owner, you can kick people for violating Discord's guidelines.

However, it is essential to have a reason to kick someone. Otherwise, it may be seen as an abuse of power.

Here are activities to look out for before kicking someone:

* Spam messages
* Harassment
* Sharing child pornography
* Violating IP rights
* Sharing viruses
* Advocating self-harm or suicide
* Distributing gore content or animal cruelty
* Life threats to another user

If you see someone involved in these, you can kick them off your server or report them to moderators or server owners if you don't have kicking authority.

In case the moderators or owners do not act on your complaint, you can always contact the Trust and Safety team.

If you happen to be a moderator or server owner, you have the authority to kick people off your server. Here is how to do it:

1. Go to the correct channel on Discord
2. Find the user from the user list on the right side of the screen
3. Right-click on their username and then select "Kick"
4. Click on "Kick" again to confirm your decision

## Part 4: FAQs About Discord Reporting

There is no need to Google responses to "How do you report someone on Discord," we have answers to the most frequently asked questions:

### Can I Report People on Discord Anonymously?

According to a [moderator on Discord's subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/ave1x3/are%5Freports%5Fanonymous/), information regarding a reported case remains between the T&S team and the reporter. Nothing regarding the complaint is shared with the individual kicked.

### What Happens If I Report Someone on Discord?

After you report someone on Discord, the T&S team goes through the evidence to justify or negate your claims.

Usually, this process takes a long time as the team evaluates whether the problem is part of a broader pattern.

After conducting their research and deciding upon a punishment, the T&S team will contact the offender via email to inform them about their misconduct and the relevant consequences.

In minor offenses, the T&S team will reach out to the reporter and teach them how to block the user rather than take direct action.

### Can You Report Someone on Discord for Being Under 13?

Individuals under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Discord unless they have permission from a parent or guardian. However, it is not very easy to prove that the user is below a certain age.

If you know someone who is undoubtedly underage, then you can report them to the Trust & Safety team by filling out their form and adding evidence to back your claim.

# Discord Spoiler Tag: All You Need to Know

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

With Discord, you can [text with emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and even send GIFs. However, as servers become crowded, they get bombarded with texts. And some of these texts have spoilers for games (or other stuff) that others may not want to know or read. But ignoring spoilers was not that easy. As you scroll miles and miles of texts, your eyes are bound to catch some hints and ruin the suspense for you.

Thankfully, Discord came out with the perfect solution. Now, if you are sharing some spoilers or secrets, you can mark them as spoilers. The result is a text that is sent but is blacked out. Curious users who are not scared of spoilers can view it. Others can enjoy their bliss of ignorance.

## Part 1: How to Use Spoilers on Discord to Hide Text Messages?

And now we come to the point - **how to do spoilers on Discord**? Well, there are two ways to do it. You can run through both of them and choose whichever suits you the best. All the methods are simple to follow. Note that some are available only on the desktop.

### Method 1: Adding Spoiler Text Via Tag on Discord

1. Open the Discord app and log in using your credentials.
2. Pick a server from your server list or a friend from the friend list.
3. Type whatever you want to in the chatbox.

5. Hit the enter key to send and your spoiler is sent without spoiling anything!

![add spoiler tag to Discord  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoiler-tag-discord.jpg)

This works for the Discord desktop app, browser, and also mobile app. This is like a universal method of hiding spoilers.

You can also add ‘/spoiler’ before the spoiler content. This is an alternative to the ‘||’ we add at the start and the end.

![add spoiler tag slash to Discord ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoiler-tag-slash-discord.jpg)

### Method 2: Sending Spoiler Message with Mark as Spoiler icon

![add spoiler marker on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoiler-icon.jpg)

This method is available only on the Discord desktop app and browser version. For iOS, the steps are similar. The only difference is that you have to select the spoiler mark from the context menu.

## Part 2: How to Add Spoiler to Image and Video on Discord?

There are many scenarios where a **Discord spoiler** can come in handy. As you might be aware that Discord is quite popular and its cross-platform flexibility make it a favorite among gamers. You can connect to your friends over multiple devices with a single account.

Just like texts, even images, videos, and other attachments can be marked as spoilers. The process of marking images and videos as spoilers differs slightly from that of texts. So, how to add spoiler tags to other files? Here’s the rundown.

![add spoiler to image and video on Discord  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoilers-to-image-video.jpg)

Images can be tagged as spoilers before you upload them on servers. To add spoiler tags to images –

* Open Discord on your desktop app or browser.
* Select the image or video that you want to send on the server.
* Drag it to your server chat and drop it there.
* Next, tap on the ‘+’ symbol.
* From the options that appear, choose 'Mark as Spoiler.'
* Hit the Upload button.
* The result is a blurred image sent on the server. Anyone who wishes to view the image can tap on it.

Note that spoilers that contain images, videos, or other multimedia files can be sent only on the desktop app or the browser. Mobile apps do not support spoiler marks for images or other media files.

## Bonus: Is it the same to use Spoiler on Mobile devices?

The **Discord mobile spoiler** tag works the same on mobile apps. The process is more or less the same. Here is a quick rundown of the steps –

1. Type out the spoiler text.
2. Add ‘||’ symbols at the start and end of the text you want to hide.
3. Hit the send button, and your spoiler text will be covered.
4. Only the curious ones can tap and see your spoiler texts.

You can even mark embedded links as spoilers with the same process. But this does not apply to Discord server links. Furthermore, **you cannot add spoiler tags to images, videos, and other files from the mobile app.**

For iOS, you can select and highlight the text that you want to hide. Then, tap open the context menu and click on the ‘Mark as Spoiler’ to hide the text.

## Bonus: How to turn off the Spoiler tag?

For some reason, you may want to remove the spoiler tag from the spoiler texts. In that case, open the User Settings and tap on Text & Images. Scroll down to the Show Spoiler Content tab and you will see options to control when spoiler content is displayed. You can choose to display on click, on servers I moderate, and always.

If you want to display all spoiler content, choose Always to turn off the spoiler tag. You can hide them again through the same menu if you change your mind.
