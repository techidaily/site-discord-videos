 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord is a widely used platform for gaming, joining new online communities, stream games with friends, meet new people, and chat. In 2019, Discord had over 250 million users. And over 6 million servers. And these numbers keep bloating every year.

If you are new to discord, it might take you a while to get the hang of the app. **How to add friends on Discord**? Moreover, discord is no fun without active servers or friends. But we are here to help you add friends on discord.

Before that – why would you want to add friends on Discord? Well, why not! You can chat with them personally, show off your gaming skills by streaming games, or add them to your servers!

## Part 1: How to Add Friends on Discord on Computer?

Discord is supposed to make gaming an interactive and lively experience. So, you should start adding friends right away. Here are the steps for adding friends on Discord. The process is the same for the desktop app and browser Discord. You can add friends through two ways -

### How to Add friends directly on Discord desktop

With this method, you can add friends using their Discord username and tag. Make sure you have their tag.

If you are using a desktop app or the website, here is how you can add friends -

1. Open the desktop app or visit the site. Tap the home button on the top towards the left.
2. Open the direct message list. In the list, click on the ‘Add friend’ tab.

![ Add friends directly on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-directly-discord.jpg)

1. In the menu that appears, input your friend's discord tag in the search box. Make sure that the capitalization, spelling, spaces or numbers are correct.
2. Hit the send friend request button to send the friend request.

![ Send friends request on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/send-friend-request-on-discord.jpg)

1. The friend will appear in your friend list once they accept your friend request.

Now you can chat with them personally.

### 2\. How to add friends on Discord Server

Severs are the places where you find your best buddies who obsess over the same things. If you want to add a friend that you met on a server, follow these steps -

1. Open the server that you and your friend are a part of.
2. Tap on your friend’s profile. You can find their profile in the user list of the server.

![ add friends on Discord server](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-on-discord-server.jpg)

1. View their profile. Click open the profile's menu.
2. Hit the Add Friend option and once the person accepts your request, you will find them in your friend list.

You can directly text or call the people who get added to your friend list.

Similarly, if a person (who’s not on your Friends List) has messaged you directly, you add them as a friend quickly.

To do this, open your chat list by clicking on your profile. Find the person you want to add to the chat list, and right-click on their profile. Tap the ‘Add Friend’ option. This is the fastest way to add friends on Discord without their user tag.

## Part 2: How to Add friends on Discord on Android and iOS?

The user interface of discord is more or less the same across various devices. The process of adding friends is quite similar to the one we discussed for the computer.

You cannot use discord over a phone's browser. To use discord on your phone, you have to download the app. It is available on Google Play Store and App Store. Once you have downloaded the app and logged in, here is **how to add people on Discord**.

### 1\. How to Add friends directly on Discord Mobile

If you have some friends that you do not share common channels with, you can add them directly with their username and Discord tag. Make sure you note down their user name and tag.

1. Open the discord app.
2. Tap on the Friends button that is located towards the bottom.

![ add friends on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friend-on-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Then tap on the ‘Add friend’ symbol that appears toward the top under the right side.
2. A box appears. Enter the discord username and the tag number.
3. Hit the send friend request button once the search result appears.
4. Your friend request will be sent. The friend would be visible in your friend's list once they have approved your friend request.

Once your friend is added, you can directly message them or call them.

### 2\. How to add friends on Discord Server

discord is all about stumbling upon like-minded people and growing your gaming group. Once you join a server, you are bound to make a lot of friends. And sometimes, you might want to add them to your friend's list so you can text them personally.

Follow these steps to add a friend that you met on the server.

1. Open your discord app.
2. Click open the server that you and your friend are a part of.
3. Open the list of channel users. The button for the list is located towards the top at the right corner.
4. Find your friend on the list. When you find your friend, tap on their profile.
5. Their profile will pop up. Click the ‘add friend’ button.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-from-server-on-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Your friend request will be delivered.
2. Once they approve, they will be a part of your friend list.

Likewise, you can build a community of your own by creating a new server. You can invite your friends or people that you met while playing games or obsessing over some fandom.

## Part 3: How to Find Someone and Add Friends on Discord Without Number

In case you have been using discord for a while, you might have realized that the only way to add friends is by username and the Discord tag number. However, there is a way to add friends without the tag. And here is how to do it –

1. Open the Discord app on your phone.
2. Tap those ‘three parallel lines’ buttons located on the top left.
3. Tap the Friends symbol that appears on the bottom tab.
4. Tap on the ‘Add Friends’ button and you will see two tabs: Username and Nearby Scan. Select the Nearby Scan option.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile without numbers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-on-discord-mobile-without-number.jpg)

1. Ask your friend to turn on the Nearby Scan mode on their phone too.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile with nearby scan feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-nearby-scan-discord.jpg)

1. When your friend gets detected, they appear on the radar.
2. Hit the ‘Send’ button to send a Friend Request.
3. Once they accept your request, they will make their way to your Friends List.

Note that this method only works on the mobile app (it doesn't matter if you have an Android phone or iPhone). You cannot perform this with a PC or laptop.

Further, you and your friend both must be on the Nearby Scan mode to connect with this feature. This method only works for connections that are within a 10-meter radius. So, if your pal is from a whole different continent, you will need a user tag to add them as friends.

If you and the person you want to add are on the same server, you can add them through the channel user lists, as we discussed above.

## Bonus: How to Add friends on Discord without user tag via an invitation link

On Discord channels, it always ‘the more, the merrier.’ And your server can be one lonely place without friends. Plus, adding friends via a server is a lot easier and needs fewer steps. Create a server and customize it according to your taste. Don’t forget to add bots for fun!

1. Open your discord, and head over to the server that you want to add friends to.
2. Right-click on the server title. A menu with several options will appear.
3. From that list, choose ‘invite friends’ and an invite link will appear on the pop-up menu.

![add friends to Discord Server via invitation links](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-to-discord-server-via-invitation-link.jpg)

1. The invitation link typically expires in a day. But you can change this setting to ‘set this link to never expire.

![set Discord invitation links](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-discord-invitation-link.jpg)

1. Share this link with your friends over other social media apps to invite them.
2. Your friends will show up on the member list of your channel when they accept your invite and follow the link.
3. From here, you can right-click on the profile that you want to add as your Friend.
4. From the drop-down that appears, tap on the ‘Profile’ option.
5. The profile opens up. Here, click on the ‘send friend request’ option.

The person will receive the request. Upon approval, the friend will be added to your Friends list. This method does not require a user tag, and you can directly add your friends through the channel member's list.

This was a guide on **how to add friends in Discord** with user tags and from servers. You can view the sent and pending friend requests.

2. Tap on your friend’s profile. You can find their profile in the user list of the server.

![ add friends on Discord server](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-on-discord-server.jpg)

1. View their profile. Click open the profile's menu.
2. Hit the Add Friend option and once the person accepts your request, you will find them in your friend list.

You can directly text or call the people who get added to your friend list.

Similarly, if a person (who’s not on your Friends List) has messaged you directly, you add them as a friend quickly.

To do this, open your chat list by clicking on your profile. Find the person you want to add to the chat list, and right-click on their profile. Tap the ‘Add Friend’ option. This is the fastest way to add friends on Discord without their user tag.

## Part 2: How to Add friends on Discord on Android and iOS?

The user interface of discord is more or less the same across various devices. The process of adding friends is quite similar to the one we discussed for the computer.

You cannot use discord over a phone's browser. To use discord on your phone, you have to download the app. It is available on Google Play Store and App Store. Once you have downloaded the app and logged in, here is **how to add people on Discord**.

### 1\. How to Add friends directly on Discord Mobile

If you have some friends that you do not share common channels with, you can add them directly with their username and Discord tag. Make sure you note down their user name and tag.

1. Open the discord app.
2. Tap on the Friends button that is located towards the bottom.

![ add friends on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friend-on-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Then tap on the ‘Add friend’ symbol that appears toward the top under the right side.
2. A box appears. Enter the discord username and the tag number.
3. Hit the send friend request button once the search result appears.
4. Your friend request will be sent. The friend would be visible in your friend's list once they have approved your friend request.

Once your friend is added, you can directly message them or call them.

### 2\. How to add friends on Discord Server

discord is all about stumbling upon like-minded people and growing your gaming group. Once you join a server, you are bound to make a lot of friends. And sometimes, you might want to add them to your friend's list so you can text them personally.

Follow these steps to add a friend that you met on the server.

1. Open your discord app.
2. Click open the server that you and your friend are a part of.
3. Open the list of channel users. The button for the list is located towards the top at the right corner.
4. Find your friend on the list. When you find your friend, tap on their profile.
5. Their profile will pop up. Click the ‘add friend’ button.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-from-server-on-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Your friend request will be delivered.
2. Once they approve, they will be a part of your friend list.

Likewise, you can build a community of your own by creating a new server. You can invite your friends or people that you met while playing games or obsessing over some fandom.

## Part 3: How to Find Someone and Add Friends on Discord Without Number

In case you have been using discord for a while, you might have realized that the only way to add friends is by username and the Discord tag number. However, there is a way to add friends without the tag. And here is how to do it –

1. Open the Discord app on your phone.
2. Tap those ‘three parallel lines’ buttons located on the top left.
3. Tap the Friends symbol that appears on the bottom tab.
4. Tap on the ‘Add Friends’ button and you will see two tabs: Username and Nearby Scan. Select the Nearby Scan option.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile without numbers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-on-discord-mobile-without-number.jpg)

1. Ask your friend to turn on the Nearby Scan mode on their phone too.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile with nearby scan feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-nearby-scan-discord.jpg)

1. When your friend gets detected, they appear on the radar.
2. Hit the ‘Send’ button to send a Friend Request.
3. Once they accept your request, they will make their way to your Friends List.

Note that this method only works on the mobile app (it doesn't matter if you have an Android phone or iPhone). You cannot perform this with a PC or laptop.

Further, you and your friend both must be on the Nearby Scan mode to connect with this feature. This method only works for connections that are within a 10-meter radius. So, if your pal is from a whole different continent, you will need a user tag to add them as friends.

If you and the person you want to add are on the same server, you can add them through the channel user lists, as we discussed above.

## Bonus: How to Add friends on Discord without user tag via an invitation link

On Discord channels, it always ‘the more, the merrier.’ And your server can be one lonely place without friends. Plus, adding friends via a server is a lot easier and needs fewer steps. Create a server and customize it according to your taste. Don’t forget to add bots for fun!

1. Open your discord, and head over to the server that you want to add friends to.
2. Right-click on the server title. A menu with several options will appear.
3. From that list, choose ‘invite friends’ and an invite link will appear on the pop-up menu.

![add friends to Discord Server via invitation links](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-to-discord-server-via-invitation-link.jpg)

1. The invitation link typically expires in a day. But you can change this setting to ‘set this link to never expire.

![set Discord invitation links](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-discord-invitation-link.jpg)

1. Share this link with your friends over other social media apps to invite them.
2. Your friends will show up on the member list of your channel when they accept your invite and follow the link.
3. From here, you can right-click on the profile that you want to add as your Friend.
4. From the drop-down that appears, tap on the ‘Profile’ option.
5. The profile opens up. Here, click on the ‘send friend request’ option.

The person will receive the request. Upon approval, the friend will be added to your Friends list. This method does not require a user tag, and you can directly add your friends through the channel member's list.

This was a guide on **how to add friends in Discord** with user tags and from servers. You can view the sent and pending friend requests.

## Enterprise Communication Showdown: Slack Versus Discord?

# Slack Vs. Discord: Which Is Better for Your Team

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

[Discord](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)is popular among gamers as they use it to connect with team members, stream their play, and interact within the community.

Though, that is not to say that Discord is useless for non-gaming purposes.

[Slack](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)offers a pretty similar scope of use to Discord as a group chat application. However, it only caters to working individuals looking to liaison for projects and communicate effortlessly for work-related tasks.

Although they may be similar in a lot of ways, which is better for your needs? Let's compare them in detail and find out!

## Part 1: Discord Vs. Slack Pricing

Pricing is where Slack takes a hit. If you're low on budget, Discord is definitely a better option. Slack users must pay for a subscription, with the plans starting from $6.67 per month for simple features, such as removing the limit of 10,000 searchable messages and 10 integrations.

For extended features, such as guest access, 99.99% uptime, and 24/7 customer care, customers will have to shell out $12.5 per month.

In contrast, Discord offers **free access** to users with pretty much no limitations. Users can keep their team's message history in the free version and generally access most of the features.

However, if you want extra perks, such as higher screen sharing quality, extras space, or [animated emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can subscribe to the [Discord Nitro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) plan. **Slack vs. Discord has a clear winner if you're only considering the price point: Discord!**

![Discord Nitro Pricing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-pricing.jpg)

_Discord has a Nitro plan that provides unfiltered service, whereas it is still completely usable without it._

![Slack  Pricing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-pricing.jpg)

_Slack has various limits to features on three different levels_

## Part 2: Discord Vs. Slack Interface

Both apps share many similarities in their template and interface. Users will find their contacts on the left and conversations on the right on both apps.

However, Slack's interface is much more user-friendly and concise, with all the DMs, apps, and channels visible on the right.

In contrast, users might be initially thrown off by Discord due to its more complicated nature. If they want to access channels and direct messages, they will have to find them through different menus.

But compared to Slack, users will find it easier to customize their [Discord profile](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). They can add different theme colors and a light mode.

Slack's customization options also offer variety, but applying the changes can be quite cumbersome because of the complicated format. Discord is more intuitive when compared to Slack in terms of use.

Also, what you see as servers in Discord are essentially teams in Slack, and switching teams in Slack is more complicated than changing Discord servers.

![Discord interface   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-interface.jpg)

Lastly, when using Discord, you can join and leave servers at will, while you will have to go through an onboarding process for each team in Slack.

![Slack  interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-preferences-settings.jpg)

Slack vs. Discord is so hotly contested because of their similarities, and the interface is the biggest one of them all!

## Part 3: Discord Vs. Slack Conversations

Slack gives users the liberty to communicate in various ways, including direct messages, public conversations, and private channels.

In contrast, Discord channels only allow for communication using text and voice. Channel [members can be assigned specific roles,](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and users can also communicate via private channels.

Moreover, Slack does not have an official limit for team members, while Discord does have a server limit of 500,000 members.

If the number of online members exceeds 250,000, users need to contact Discord support for extra server space.

**Image**: _Discord (left) and Slack (right) also have a very similar way to send direct messages to various accounts_

## Part 4: Slack Vs. Discord Video Call

Discord is known for its [voice calls](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), allowing users to access special voice channels to just join and start speaking.

![Discord Video call   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg)

This feature is desirable to gamers who want to interact with friends in between games. Users can speak to 5,000 people simultaneously and see up to 9 friends at a time.

In contrast, Slack offers quite basic video calling features, missing out on crucial features like noise suspension and echo cancellation, which Discord offers.

Also, Discord offers a push-to-talk feature where users can turn their mics on during gaming sessions.

![Slack Video Conferencing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-video-conferencing.jpg)

_On Discord (left), the video call hub will drop down from the top, whereas, on Slack (left), the hub appears in the middle of the screen_

Both of these apps do not feature built-in voice messaging. Slack does offer the luxury of recording voice messages, but that requires third-party integration. Discord completely misses out on this feature.

If we were to rate the two apps for video calling features, **Discord seems to come out on top, offering many advanced features for its users.**

## Part 5: Discord Vs. Slack File Sharing

Users can share files on both Discord and Slack, with the size limit of files being the main difference.

With Discord, users can share files up to 8MB, but upgrading to the Nitro plan increases this limit to 15MB. In contrast, Slack allows users to share files up to 1GB.

However, Slack users cannot save these shared files forever, while Discord allows their users to save unlimited messages and file history.

This feature is handy if users need to access the files they shared in the past. They can also subscribe to the Nitro plan for longer backlogs and get a 50MB limit per file instead of the 8MB in the free version.

![Discord screensharing   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-screen-sharing-friends.jpg)

With Slack, users can even share Google Drive, along with code and text snippets, which is a valuable feature for business and work-related file-sharing.

In contrast, users can only share files from their own device on Discord. However, it is necessary to confirm before sharing files in both apps, which can be cumbersome for large file transfers.

![Slack screensharing   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-screen-sharing.jpg)

_The file-sharing prompt on Discord (left) and Slack (right) is also somewhat similar, with both providing instant sharing by holding down the Shift button_

## Part 6: Discord Vs. Slack Screen Sharing

Slack restricts video calls to two people, except for users who have subscribed to an extension plan. For paid users, the limit extends to 15 people.

It allows anyone to share their screen on a video call, regardless of their payment plan, and users can access both video and voice calls with the same button.

Discord also allows users to [share their screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with other members, giving them the luxury to share their entire screen, a particular window, or gameplay with up to 9 people at a time, without making any changes to the settings.

**Image**: _The screen sharing tools on Discord (Left) are more descriptive and provide more options than those for Slack (Left)_

## Part 7: Discord Vs. Slack Summary

When it comes to video calling and file-sharing, both apps can boast their qualities, catering to different target audiences and serving various purposes.

Discord prioritizes voice chat, where gamers can communicate with their friends while playing games. Slack is more business-centric as it emphasizes text chat, file transfers, and project collaboration, with a slightly more formal structure.

If you're looking for a more social-media-oriented network, where you can communicate with your peers easily in an informal manner, Discord is the right app for you. It is a dream for gamers, and now even for people collaborating at work!

However, if you're looking for an app that caters more to work-related purposes, with a large number of integrations, and a text-oriented layout, Slack will serve you well. It's an adequate team chat app for businesses and organizations.

At the end of the day, **Slack vs. Discord** is a fight whose victor is down to the user. What app you choose depends on your purpose and the goal you want to achieve.

And although Discord is well-placed to be the future of communications, as it stands, some gamers use Slack, and some businessmen use Discord. So, there's no saying that one app serves only one specific purpose.

However, Slack users cannot save these shared files forever, while Discord allows their users to save unlimited messages and file history.

This feature is handy if users need to access the files they shared in the past. They can also subscribe to the Nitro plan for longer backlogs and get a 50MB limit per file instead of the 8MB in the free version.

![Discord screensharing   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-screen-sharing-friends.jpg)

With Slack, users can even share Google Drive, along with code and text snippets, which is a valuable feature for business and work-related file-sharing.

In contrast, users can only share files from their own device on Discord. However, it is necessary to confirm before sharing files in both apps, which can be cumbersome for large file transfers.

![Slack screensharing   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-screen-sharing.jpg)

_The file-sharing prompt on Discord (left) and Slack (right) is also somewhat similar, with both providing instant sharing by holding down the Shift button_

## Part 6: Discord Vs. Slack Screen Sharing

Slack restricts video calls to two people, except for users who have subscribed to an extension plan. For paid users, the limit extends to 15 people.

It allows anyone to share their screen on a video call, regardless of their payment plan, and users can access both video and voice calls with the same button.

Discord also allows users to [share their screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with other members, giving them the luxury to share their entire screen, a particular window, or gameplay with up to 9 people at a time, without making any changes to the settings.

## Part 7: Discord Vs. Slack Summary

When it comes to video calling and file-sharing, both apps can boast their qualities, catering to different target audiences and serving various purposes.

Discord prioritizes voice chat, where gamers can communicate with their friends while playing games. Slack is more business-centric as it emphasizes text chat, file transfers, and project collaboration, with a slightly more formal structure.

If you're looking for a more social-media-oriented network, where you can communicate with your peers easily in an informal manner, Discord is the right app for you. It is a dream for gamers, and now even for people collaborating at work!

However, if you're looking for an app that caters more to work-related purposes, with a large number of integrations, and a text-oriented layout, Slack will serve you well. It's an adequate team chat app for businesses and organizations.

At the end of the day, **Slack vs. Discord** is a fight whose victor is down to the user. What app you choose depends on your purpose and the goal you want to achieve.

And although Discord is well-placed to be the future of communications, as it stands, some gamers use Slack, and some businessmen use Discord. So, there's no saying that one app serves only one specific purpose.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

[Discord](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)is popular among gamers as they use it to connect with team members, stream their play, and interact within the community.

Though, that is not to say that Discord is useless for non-gaming purposes.

[Slack](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)offers a pretty similar scope of use to Discord as a group chat application. However, it only caters to working individuals looking to liaison for projects and communicate effortlessly for work-related tasks.

Although they may be similar in a lot of ways, which is better for your needs? Let's compare them in detail and find out!

## Part 1: Discord Vs. Slack Pricing

Pricing is where Slack takes a hit. If you're low on budget, Discord is definitely a better option. Slack users must pay for a subscription, with the plans starting from $6.67 per month for simple features, such as removing the limit of 10,000 searchable messages and 10 integrations.

For extended features, such as guest access, 99.99% uptime, and 24/7 customer care, customers will have to shell out $12.5 per month.

In contrast, Discord offers **free access** to users with pretty much no limitations. Users can keep their team's message history in the free version and generally access most of the features.

However, if you want extra perks, such as higher screen sharing quality, extras space, or [animated emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can subscribe to the [Discord Nitro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) plan. **Slack vs. Discord has a clear winner if you're only considering the price point: Discord!**

![Discord Nitro Pricing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-pricing.jpg)

_Discord has a Nitro plan that provides unfiltered service, whereas it is still completely usable without it._

![Slack  Pricing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-pricing.jpg)

_Slack has various limits to features on three different levels_

## Part 2: Discord Vs. Slack Interface

Both apps share many similarities in their template and interface. Users will find their contacts on the left and conversations on the right on both apps.

However, Slack's interface is much more user-friendly and concise, with all the DMs, apps, and channels visible on the right.

In contrast, users might be initially thrown off by Discord due to its more complicated nature. If they want to access channels and direct messages, they will have to find them through different menus.

But compared to Slack, users will find it easier to customize their [Discord profile](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). They can add different theme colors and a light mode.

Slack's customization options also offer variety, but applying the changes can be quite cumbersome because of the complicated format. Discord is more intuitive when compared to Slack in terms of use.

Also, what you see as servers in Discord are essentially teams in Slack, and switching teams in Slack is more complicated than changing Discord servers.

![Discord interface   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-interface.jpg)

Lastly, when using Discord, you can join and leave servers at will, while you will have to go through an onboarding process for each team in Slack.

![Slack  interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-preferences-settings.jpg)

Slack vs. Discord is so hotly contested because of their similarities, and the interface is the biggest one of them all!

## Part 3: Discord Vs. Slack Conversations

Slack gives users the liberty to communicate in various ways, including direct messages, public conversations, and private channels.

In contrast, Discord channels only allow for communication using text and voice. Channel [members can be assigned specific roles,](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and users can also communicate via private channels.

Moreover, Slack does not have an official limit for team members, while Discord does have a server limit of 500,000 members.

If the number of online members exceeds 250,000, users need to contact Discord support for extra server space.

**Image**: _Discord (left) and Slack (right) also have a very similar way to send direct messages to various accounts_

## Part 4: Slack Vs. Discord Video Call

Discord is known for its [voice calls](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), allowing users to access special voice channels to just join and start speaking.

![Discord Video call   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg)

This feature is desirable to gamers who want to interact with friends in between games. Users can speak to 5,000 people simultaneously and see up to 9 friends at a time.

In contrast, Slack offers quite basic video calling features, missing out on crucial features like noise suspension and echo cancellation, which Discord offers.

Also, Discord offers a push-to-talk feature where users can turn their mics on during gaming sessions.

![Slack Video Conferencing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-video-conferencing.jpg)

_On Discord (left), the video call hub will drop down from the top, whereas, on Slack (left), the hub appears in the middle of the screen_

Both of these apps do not feature built-in voice messaging. Slack does offer the luxury of recording voice messages, but that requires third-party integration. Discord completely misses out on this feature.

If we were to rate the two apps for video calling features, **Discord seems to come out on top, offering many advanced features for its users.**

## Part 5: Discord Vs. Slack File Sharing

Users can share files on both Discord and Slack, with the size limit of files being the main difference.

With Discord, users can share files up to 8MB, but upgrading to the Nitro plan increases this limit to 15MB. In contrast, Slack allows users to share files up to 1GB.

However, Slack users cannot save these shared files forever, while Discord allows their users to save unlimited messages and file history.

This feature is handy if users need to access the files they shared in the past. They can also subscribe to the Nitro plan for longer backlogs and get a 50MB limit per file instead of the 8MB in the free version.

![Discord screensharing   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-screen-sharing-friends.jpg)

With Slack, users can even share Google Drive, along with code and text snippets, which is a valuable feature for business and work-related file-sharing.

In contrast, users can only share files from their own device on Discord. However, it is necessary to confirm before sharing files in both apps, which can be cumbersome for large file transfers.

![Slack screensharing   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-screen-sharing.jpg)

_The file-sharing prompt on Discord (left) and Slack (right) is also somewhat similar, with both providing instant sharing by holding down the Shift button_

## Part 6: Discord Vs. Slack Screen Sharing

Slack restricts video calls to two people, except for users who have subscribed to an extension plan. For paid users, the limit extends to 15 people.

It allows anyone to share their screen on a video call, regardless of their payment plan, and users can access both video and voice calls with the same button.
