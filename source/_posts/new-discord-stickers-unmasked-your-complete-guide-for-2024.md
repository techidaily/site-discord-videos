From Facebook to even WhatsApp and Telegram, plain texts have become boring. Sticker fights on WhatsApp will give you an idea of how popular stickers are. Stickers are the new trend, and Discord just cannot lag behind in the race. Considering this, Discord is about to launch some lively, animated stickers.

* [**Part 3: How to Buy Discord Stickers?**](#part3)
* [**Part 4: How to Buy or Redeem a Discord Sticker Pack**](#part4)
* [**Part 5: How to Use Stickers on Discord?**](#part5)

## Part 1: What’s Discord Sticker?

Discord Sticker supports sending emojis and GIFs on chats. The stickers have been soft-launched in Japan, Canada, and Brazil. After testing and feedback, they will be available across the globe.

Luckily, if you are a Nitro user, you can access the stickers for free. These stickers are bundled in the Nitro subscription, and you can claim the cool new stickers for free. Just go to the sticker shop, and tap on the "Free" button to start using them.

For those of you who have a $4.99 subscription, you can get the What's Up Wumpus sticker pack for free. $9.99 subscription holders can unlock the What's Up Wumpus sticker pack and can use the Wumpus Nitro Elite pack as long as their subscription is active.

The $9.99 subscribers can also avail of a 33% discount on other **Discord sticker packs**. Once you purchase these stickers, they are a permanent part of your Discord inventory. Other than these, the shop has Doggo Replies, Nelly At Work, and Hello Wumpus stickers as default sticker packs.

After the soft launch, the Sticker Shop is available for the users across all the platforms – Android, iOS, and even on the desktop app and browser.

## Part 2: How to Find Sticker Shop and Get Discord Stickers for Free?

### \- On Phone

If you are lucky enough to be in Brazil, Japan, or Canada, you can access the Sticker Shop. You can tap on the emoji icon (the one that appears on the text box). The box that opens shows the emoji, and GIF tabs along with the sticker tab.

Tap on the sticker tab. A 'shop' symbol pops up towards the bottom (right hand). Tap on the symbol to open the sticker gallery. Here, you will see all the available sticker packs.

### \- Desktop (Browser)

![Discord Sticker Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-stickers-options.jpg)

If you use Discord on your desktop or browser, you can see the sticker icon right on the text bar. Tap on it, and then click on the shopping icon that appears towards the bottom (left corner). In the shop, you can browse through the sticker packs.

![Discord Stickers Browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/browser-and-buy-discord-sticker.jpg)

Nitro users will get the What's Up Wumpus stickers for free. However, they will have to buy other packs. The $9.99 Nitro users will get a 33% discount on sticker packs.

For now, the stickers can be used only by users in Japan, Brazil, and Canada. These users can send stickers to users in other countries. However, the receivers can see the stickers but cannot buy or send them.

However, you can try and use a VPN proxy to gain early access to it.

## Part 3: How to Buy Discord Stickers?

As we described above, you can access the sticker shop on your phone as well as desktop. Once in the shop, you can browse and pick the stickers to buy.

Before buying, you can view the stickers in the sticker pack. As a sample, you will be shown a few stickers. You can view the entire pack by tapping on the 'View All' tab.

## Part 4: How to Buy or Redeem a Discord Sticker Pack

Here is a brief rundown of the steps to follow if you want to buy a sticker pack.

* Choose a sticker pack that you like. View all the stickers to see what the pack looks like.
* Tap on the purchase button that is located right beside the name of the pack.
* You will be prompted to input your payment details. If you have saved a payment option on Discord, you can choose the relevant option.
* Agree to the Terms and Services of Discord.
* Finally, hit the purchase tab.
* The sticker pack is added to the inventory instantly.
* You can start sending them in the texts.

Note that Discord does not refund the money that is once paid. So, you cannot return the stickers to get a refund.

Another interesting thing to note is that the Sticker Shop refreshes and offers new sticker packs. Due to this rotation, a pack that is available in the shop today may be replaced by a new one tomorrow.

But don't worry. A timer displayed at the top left corner (besides the title) lets you know for how long the pack is available in the shop. You can grab it before the time runs out.

## Part 5: How to Use Stickers on Discord?

Buying stickers is useless if you don't send them over texts. So, once you purchase stickers, you can immediately start sending them to your servers and texts.

### 1\. Sending Stickers on Discord Mobile App

![ send Discord Stickers on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sending-stickers-discord-mobile.jpg)

If you have the Discord app on your phone, tap on the emoji button. The Stickers tab appears, and this menu enables you to send the most-used stickers quickly, view all the purchased stickers, and search for appropriate stickers.

You can type an expression or emoji in the ‘Find the perfect sticker’ bar to find the right sticker. Hit the send button once you find the apt sticker.

### 2\. Sending Stickers from Discord Desktop (and over Browser)

![send Discord Stickers online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/send-sticker-discord-desktop-online.jpg)

Sending stickers on a desktop or browser is quite similar to the mobile process. On the chatbox, you will find the sticker icon. Tap on it to view your purchased sticker packs.

Once opened, the menu will show you the most-used stickers. You can view other packs and switch between them. You can also search for particular stickers by typing the terms on the search bar.

You can tap on a sticker to send it on chats and servers.

## Bonus: Adding Face-tracking AR Stickers to Video with [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

In the latest version of Wondershare Filmora (V10.5 and later version), you can add face-tracking AR stickers to people in the video, and light up the celebration with flashy and cute characters and elements. Here are some brief steps to add AR stickers to your video in Filmora.

### Step 1\. Download and install the latest version of Filmora

Click the button below to download and install the latest version of Filmora. If you have installed Filmora already, click the **About** option under the **Help** menu to check the version of Filmora.

[![Download Filmora  Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora   Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Note: You need to run Filmora 10.5 and later versions to add the AR stickers.

### Step 2\. Drag and drop your video footage to timeline

After launching Filmora, you need to import the video footage to the video editor. You can drag and drop the video footage to the timeline directly if you are working on a simple video project.

However, if you are working on a video project with many footages, it is recommended to upload them to the media library in order.

### Step 3\. Add AR Stickers to the video

After trimming or cutting out unnecessary frames from the video, you can now add the AR stickers to the footage. Go to the Effects tab and then scroll down to the **AR Sticker** directory.

![ Filmora AR Stickers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ar-sticker-directory.jpg)

Currently, there are 40 stickers available in Filmora. You can click each one to preview and download. To add a sticker to the video, you can drag and drop it to the video track above or to the video clip directly. You can add several stickers at the same time by placing them in the tracks accordingly.

![ Filmora AR Stickers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-multiple-ar-stickers-video.jpg)

### Step 4\. Preview and Export

After finishing the editing, you can click the play button in the preview window to preview, and then click the **Export** button to save the video.

## FAQs about Discord Sticker

And here we will answer some stuff that you might wonder about.

1. **What’s the difference between Discord Sticker and [Discord Emoji](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)?**

Well, emojis are emojis, and they are even in-built into your Android (or Google) and other keyboards on your phone. Emojis are not animated, and you can send basic Smiley or Sad faces (of course, there are animals and flowers, too). On the other hand, stickers are animated, and there can be specific sticker characters like What's Up Wumpus.

1. **Why can't I see the Sticker option on my Discord app?**

You cannot access the stickers on Discord probably because the feature has not been launched in your country yet. Stickers are only available for users in Brazil, Japan, and Canada. They will be launched in other countries after testing and feedback.

1. **Is Discord sticker free?**

If you are a Nitro subscriber, you will get the What’s Up Wumpus sticker pack for free. You will have to buy the other packs. As a $9.99 Nitro subscriber, you can get other packs at a 33% discount.

1. **Can I keep the purchased sticker pack forever in my account?**

Yes, once you buy a pack, you will have lifetime access to it. However, if you delete your Discord account, you will not get your stickers back. Further, packs like ‘Wumpus Nitro Elite’ can be accessed only on an active $9.99 subscription.

1. **Can people who are outside of Brazil, Canada, and Japan receive the stickers I sent?**

Yes, users from countries other than Japan, Canada, and Brazil can see the stickers in the chat sent to them. However, they could not buy or send them.

1. **Why my Discord sticker is not moving/animating?**

The stickers should move by default when sent. You can check if your sticker inventory is set to the smallest size. You can also go to User Settings, tap on Text & Images, and select Stickers. Adjust the settings appropriately. You can contact the Discord support team should you need further assistance.

Be patient until the cool update rolls out worldwide!

And here we will answer some stuff that you might wonder about.

1. **What’s the difference between Discord Sticker and [Discord Emoji](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)?**

Well, emojis are emojis, and they are even in-built into your Android (or Google) and other keyboards on your phone. Emojis are not animated, and you can send basic Smiley or Sad faces (of course, there are animals and flowers, too). On the other hand, stickers are animated, and there can be specific sticker characters like What's Up Wumpus.

1. **Why can't I see the Sticker option on my Discord app?**

You cannot access the stickers on Discord probably because the feature has not been launched in your country yet. Stickers are only available for users in Brazil, Japan, and Canada. They will be launched in other countries after testing and feedback.

1. **Is Discord sticker free?**

If you are a Nitro subscriber, you will get the What’s Up Wumpus sticker pack for free. You will have to buy the other packs. As a $9.99 Nitro subscriber, you can get other packs at a 33% discount.

1. **Can I keep the purchased sticker pack forever in my account?**

Yes, once you buy a pack, you will have lifetime access to it. However, if you delete your Discord account, you will not get your stickers back. Further, packs like ‘Wumpus Nitro Elite’ can be accessed only on an active $9.99 subscription.

1. **Can people who are outside of Brazil, Canada, and Japan receive the stickers I sent?**

Yes, users from countries other than Japan, Canada, and Brazil can see the stickers in the chat sent to them. However, they could not buy or send them.

1. **Why my Discord sticker is not moving/animating?**

The stickers should move by default when sent. You can check if your sticker inventory is set to the smallest size. You can also go to User Settings, tap on Text & Images, and select Stickers. Adjust the settings appropriately. You can contact the Discord support team should you need further assistance.

Be patient until the cool update rolls out worldwide!

From Facebook to even WhatsApp and Telegram, plain texts have become boring. Sticker fights on WhatsApp will give you an idea of how popular stickers are. Stickers are the new trend, and Discord just cannot lag behind in the race. Considering this, Discord is about to launch some lively, animated stickers.

* [**Part 5: How to Use Stickers on Discord?**](#part5)

## Part 1: What’s Discord Sticker?

Discord Sticker supports sending emojis and GIFs on chats. The stickers have been soft-launched in Japan, Canada, and Brazil. After testing and feedback, they will be available across the globe.

Luckily, if you are a Nitro user, you can access the stickers for free. These stickers are bundled in the Nitro subscription, and you can claim the cool new stickers for free. Just go to the sticker shop, and tap on the "Free" button to start using them.

For those of you who have a $4.99 subscription, you can get the What's Up Wumpus sticker pack for free. $9.99 subscription holders can unlock the What's Up Wumpus sticker pack and can use the Wumpus Nitro Elite pack as long as their subscription is active.

The $9.99 subscribers can also avail of a 33% discount on other **Discord sticker packs**. Once you purchase these stickers, they are a permanent part of your Discord inventory. Other than these, the shop has Doggo Replies, Nelly At Work, and Hello Wumpus stickers as default sticker packs.

After the soft launch, the Sticker Shop is available for the users across all the platforms – Android, iOS, and even on the desktop app and browser.

## Part 2: How to Find Sticker Shop and Get Discord Stickers for Free?

### \- On Phone

If you are lucky enough to be in Brazil, Japan, or Canada, you can access the Sticker Shop. You can tap on the emoji icon (the one that appears on the text box). The box that opens shows the emoji, and GIF tabs along with the sticker tab.

Tap on the sticker tab. A 'shop' symbol pops up towards the bottom (right hand). Tap on the symbol to open the sticker gallery. Here, you will see all the available sticker packs.

### \- Desktop (Browser)

![Discord Sticker Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-stickers-options.jpg)

If you use Discord on your desktop or browser, you can see the sticker icon right on the text bar. Tap on it, and then click on the shopping icon that appears towards the bottom (left corner). In the shop, you can browse through the sticker packs.

![Discord Stickers Browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/browser-and-buy-discord-sticker.jpg)

Nitro users will get the What's Up Wumpus stickers for free. However, they will have to buy other packs. The $9.99 Nitro users will get a 33% discount on sticker packs.

For now, the stickers can be used only by users in Japan, Brazil, and Canada. These users can send stickers to users in other countries. However, the receivers can see the stickers but cannot buy or send them.

However, you can try and use a VPN proxy to gain early access to it.

## Part 3: How to Buy Discord Stickers?

As we described above, you can access the sticker shop on your phone as well as desktop. Once in the shop, you can browse and pick the stickers to buy.

Before buying, you can view the stickers in the sticker pack. As a sample, you will be shown a few stickers. You can view the entire pack by tapping on the 'View All' tab.

## Part 4: How to Buy or Redeem a Discord Sticker Pack

Here is a brief rundown of the steps to follow if you want to buy a sticker pack.

* Choose a sticker pack that you like. View all the stickers to see what the pack looks like.
* Tap on the purchase button that is located right beside the name of the pack.
* You will be prompted to input your payment details. If you have saved a payment option on Discord, you can choose the relevant option.
* Agree to the Terms and Services of Discord.
* Finally, hit the purchase tab.
* The sticker pack is added to the inventory instantly.
* You can start sending them in the texts.

Note that Discord does not refund the money that is once paid. So, you cannot return the stickers to get a refund.

Another interesting thing to note is that the Sticker Shop refreshes and offers new sticker packs. Due to this rotation, a pack that is available in the shop today may be replaced by a new one tomorrow.

But don't worry. A timer displayed at the top left corner (besides the title) lets you know for how long the pack is available in the shop. You can grab it before the time runs out.

## Part 5: How to Use Stickers on Discord?

Buying stickers is useless if you don't send them over texts. So, once you purchase stickers, you can immediately start sending them to your servers and texts.

### 1\. Sending Stickers on Discord Mobile App

![ send Discord Stickers on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sending-stickers-discord-mobile.jpg)

If you have the Discord app on your phone, tap on the emoji button. The Stickers tab appears, and this menu enables you to send the most-used stickers quickly, view all the purchased stickers, and search for appropriate stickers.

You can type an expression or emoji in the ‘Find the perfect sticker’ bar to find the right sticker. Hit the send button once you find the apt sticker.

### 2\. Sending Stickers from Discord Desktop (and over Browser)

![send Discord Stickers online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/send-sticker-discord-desktop-online.jpg)

Sending stickers on a desktop or browser is quite similar to the mobile process. On the chatbox, you will find the sticker icon. Tap on it to view your purchased sticker packs.

Once opened, the menu will show you the most-used stickers. You can view other packs and switch between them. You can also search for particular stickers by typing the terms on the search bar.

You can tap on a sticker to send it on chats and servers.

# A Quick Primer On What Is Discord

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord was initially launched in 2015 to provide gamers a platform where they could freely communicate and form tight-knit communities around their interests. According to a 2019 [survey](https://www.statista.com/statistics/579334/most-popular-us-social-networking-apps-ranked-by-reach/), it was ranked as the 11th most popular mobile social networking app in the US, reaching 8.03% of mobile users.

But over the last year, Discord became the go-to chat app for people from all sorts of backgrounds and niches. From like-minded Bitcoin enthusiasts to some zealous reptile lovers, you'll find all kinds of communities here.

As a result, there are currently 31,309 live [websites](https://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/Discord) that use Discord, which justifies its estimated [revenue](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/discord-statistics/) of $120 million in 2020.

The popularity of Discord has rightfully increased over the years, with its privacy features and easy-to-use interface.

## What Is Discord?

Discord has everything you need in a good communication software with its voice chats, video calls, and text options. These let users get in touch with each other, which works perfectly for gamers to form communities, coordinate, and talk while playing.

Primarily a chat app, it makes chatting while playing games on PC very convenient. However, it is not just used by gamers, as a lot of people use it as a social and organizational tool.

This past year, Discord has become the default destination for Youtubers, influencers, and Instagrammers who want to build a community around their content and connect with audiences in a more meaningful way.

## How Does Discord Work And What Can It Be Used For?

Discord is simply a communication software that allows the users to message or call one another. There are different communities on it, and each one is called a server, with individual text and voice channels for you to join. You can type, voice-chat, and share videos, links, images, music, etc.

You'll find that each channel has a unique topic or rules; for instance, one channel could be dedicated to games while another to sharing pictures of dogs, etc.

Discord serves as a social forum where people form private or public servers and discuss their shared interests. You can even start your own server if you can't find any worth joining for free. Try A Google search to find discord servers on your preferred topic or use the app's own search engine to look for a new channel.

Who doesn't like GIFs?

Discord allows you to add GIFs to your chats or mark your messages as spoilers using the "/giphy" or "/spoiler" commands, respectively.

It also lets you reach out to other people and directly message them to have a video or voice chat with them. Furthermore, it can also connect to other apps like Spotify or YouTube to improve your experience.

No matter what other activity you are doing, you can use Discord along with it. For instance, if your friends want to play a game, you can all launch the same Discord server and use any device to access it. Smack talk your friends' Mortal Combat or Street Fighter skills to your heart's content – no one's judging!

Interestingly, day traders and investors also hopped on the bandwagon because it lets them multitask and stay connected like a pro.

If these features weren't enough, Discord is also free to download and use. And if you love the experience of Discord, you can always upgrade and subscribe to Discord Nitro.

While Discord itself provides you a fantastic experience, Nitro improves it by many folds. It lets you access more features like larger file uploads, animated emojis, better-quality streaming options, and a lot more, only for $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year!

## What Makes Discord Standout?

There's a reason why Discord has managed to garner over [300 million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/746215/discord-user-number/) registered users as of June 2020\. Even though you can find many communication tools, the variety of chat options makes Discord stand out amongst others.

### 1\. Easy-To-Use Interface

Don't we all look for an easy-to-use interface in the apps or websites we use?

Discord has a good UI along with all the best features from communication apps like Slack and Skype. It also puts in a lot of effort in making the voice chat more efficient so that it is of real help while playing games.

### 2\. Provides A Social Forum

One of the best things about Discord is that it is more than just a communications software. Users actually take advantage of its chat options to meet and talk to other like-minded people making it a great social media platform.

This means that Discord isn't only good for gamers. You can use the private server to interact with friends or the public ones to make new ones.

### 3\. Setting Up Member Roles

Another one of Discord's advantage is that you can use various ways to configure its server when you create one. You can establish different roles for the community members, like making one for other moderators and administrators or special functions for the most active users.

This makes your server easier to manage, while the experience is quite rewarding for active users.

### 4\. Accessibility

As you will read below, one of the best facets of Discord is that you can use it even if you do not have a gaming PC in front of you. The web-based and mobile versions are relatively easy to use. At the same time, the downloadable PC program runs in the background while you play your games.

You can use its chat servers to interact with people from pretty much anywhere due to the multitude of platforms available.

## Where Can You Use Discord?

Whether you have Windows or Mac, you can download and use the app effortlessly.

You can also use it in-browser at its official website, though there are some limitations. For example, you won't be able to detect audio devices or a webcam and screen-sharing feature to stream desktops or windows to other people.

If you want to use it on the go, try the iOS and Android apps that offer relatively similar features as the desktop one. They have recently added the screen sharing feature to the mobile version as well making it accessible for everyone.

## How to Get Started On Discord?

Follow the guide below if you want to join Discord:

### 1\.  Creating A Discord Account

Once you have downloaded Discord on your device, click on the register link option, and create an account. Fill out the fields with relevant information, including the email you will use. Then create a username and password, and hit the "Continue" button to proceed.

Congratulations! You've entered the world of Discord. Do check your email to verify your account so you can enjoy the full functionality of this app. In case you haven't received it, click the resend button.

### 2\.  Joining A Server

Creating your account is just the beginning. Let's get to the most exciting bit, which is joining a server!

First and foremost, find the perfect server to join as there are many resources available. You can find different server communities through the search option. You can optimize your search by typing in a keyword to find one focused on a topic of your interest.

You will see servers pop up once you type in your keyword. Just click on the display card of the one that's in line with your interests. It's also possible to view the server before you join, and if you like it, you can select the "Join Server" option.

A little icon near the magnifying glass and the plus signs on the screen will be added representing the server you have joined; click on it to rejoin the server whenever you want.

### 3\.  Adding Friends

Adding friends is another exciting part of Discord, which is luckily very straightforward. Follow the easy guide to do so.

In the "Friends" tab, you can see options on the dashboard. Click on the green "Add friend" button to add someone. A screen will appear that will ask you to enter a friend's username and #number. Press the "Send Friend Request" option after this, and you would have added your first friend!

You can find your username along with the number at the bottom of your dashboard, which you can let a friend know who wants to add you.

**Conclusion**

As you would've already gathered from above, Discord is a very cool and useful app. It is not just meant for communication but to also build a social platform where you can meet other people and form communities around the same interests.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord was initially launched in 2015 to provide gamers a platform where they could freely communicate and form tight-knit communities around their interests. According to a 2019 [survey](https://www.statista.com/statistics/579334/most-popular-us-social-networking-apps-ranked-by-reach/), it was ranked as the 11th most popular mobile social networking app in the US, reaching 8.03% of mobile users.

But over the last year, Discord became the go-to chat app for people from all sorts of backgrounds and niches. From like-minded Bitcoin enthusiasts to some zealous reptile lovers, you'll find all kinds of communities here.

As a result, there are currently 31,309 live [websites](https://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/Discord) that use Discord, which justifies its estimated [revenue](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/discord-statistics/) of $120 million in 2020.

The popularity of Discord has rightfully increased over the years, with its privacy features and easy-to-use interface.

Read ahead to find out what makes it better than other communication platforms out there.

## What Is Discord?

Discord has everything you need in a good communication software with its voice chats, video calls, and text options. These let users get in touch with each other, which works perfectly for gamers to form communities, coordinate, and talk while playing.

Primarily a chat app, it makes chatting while playing games on PC very convenient. However, it is not just used by gamers, as a lot of people use it as a social and organizational tool.

This past year, Discord has become the default destination for Youtubers, influencers, and Instagrammers who want to build a community around their content and connect with audiences in a more meaningful way.

## How Does Discord Work And What Can It Be Used For?

Discord is simply a communication software that allows the users to message or call one another. There are different communities on it, and each one is called a server, with individual text and voice channels for you to join. You can type, voice-chat, and share videos, links, images, music, etc.

You'll find that each channel has a unique topic or rules; for instance, one channel could be dedicated to games while another to sharing pictures of dogs, etc.

Discord serves as a social forum where people form private or public servers and discuss their shared interests. You can even start your own server if you can't find any worth joining for free. Try A Google search to find discord servers on your preferred topic or use the app's own search engine to look for a new channel.

Who doesn't like GIFs?

Discord allows you to add GIFs to your chats or mark your messages as spoilers using the "/giphy" or "/spoiler" commands, respectively.

It also lets you reach out to other people and directly message them to have a video or voice chat with them. Furthermore, it can also connect to other apps like Spotify or YouTube to improve your experience.

No matter what other activity you are doing, you can use Discord along with it. For instance, if your friends want to play a game, you can all launch the same Discord server and use any device to access it. Smack talk your friends' Mortal Combat or Street Fighter skills to your heart's content – no one's judging!

Interestingly, day traders and investors also hopped on the bandwagon because it lets them multitask and stay connected like a pro.

If these features weren't enough, Discord is also free to download and use. And if you love the experience of Discord, you can always upgrade and subscribe to Discord Nitro.

While Discord itself provides you a fantastic experience, Nitro improves it by many folds. It lets you access more features like larger file uploads, animated emojis, better-quality streaming options, and a lot more, only for $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year!

## What Makes Discord Standout?

There's a reason why Discord has managed to garner over [300 million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/746215/discord-user-number/) registered users as of June 2020\. Even though you can find many communication tools, the variety of chat options makes Discord stand out amongst others.

### 1\. Easy-To-Use Interface

Don't we all look for an easy-to-use interface in the apps or websites we use?

Discord has a good UI along with all the best features from communication apps like Slack and Skype. It also puts in a lot of effort in making the voice chat more efficient so that it is of real help while playing games.

### 2\. Provides A Social Forum

One of the best things about Discord is that it is more than just a communications software. Users actually take advantage of its chat options to meet and talk to other like-minded people making it a great social media platform.

This means that Discord isn't only good for gamers. You can use the private server to interact with friends or the public ones to make new ones.

### 3\. Setting Up Member Roles

Another one of Discord's advantage is that you can use various ways to configure its server when you create one. You can establish different roles for the community members, like making one for other moderators and administrators or special functions for the most active users.

This makes your server easier to manage, while the experience is quite rewarding for active users.

### 4\. Accessibility

As you will read below, one of the best facets of Discord is that you can use it even if you do not have a gaming PC in front of you. The web-based and mobile versions are relatively easy to use. At the same time, the downloadable PC program runs in the background while you play your games.

You can use its chat servers to interact with people from pretty much anywhere due to the multitude of platforms available.

## Where Can You Use Discord?

Whether you have Windows or Mac, you can download and use the app effortlessly.

You can also use it in-browser at its official website, though there are some limitations. For example, you won't be able to detect audio devices or a webcam and screen-sharing feature to stream desktops or windows to other people.

If you want to use it on the go, try the iOS and Android apps that offer relatively similar features as the desktop one. They have recently added the screen sharing feature to the mobile version as well making it accessible for everyone.

## How to Get Started On Discord?

Follow the guide below if you want to join Discord:

### 1\.  Creating A Discord Account

Once you have downloaded Discord on your device, click on the register link option, and create an account. Fill out the fields with relevant information, including the email you will use. Then create a username and password, and hit the "Continue" button to proceed.

Congratulations! You've entered the world of Discord. Do check your email to verify your account so you can enjoy the full functionality of this app. In case you haven't received it, click the resend button.

### 2\.  Joining A Server

Creating your account is just the beginning. Let's get to the most exciting bit, which is joining a server!

First and foremost, find the perfect server to join as there are many resources available. You can find different server communities through the search option. You can optimize your search by typing in a keyword to find one focused on a topic of your interest.

You will see servers pop up once you type in your keyword. Just click on the display card of the one that's in line with your interests. It's also possible to view the server before you join, and if you like it, you can select the "Join Server" option.

A little icon near the magnifying glass and the plus signs on the screen will be added representing the server you have joined; click on it to rejoin the server whenever you want.

### 3\.  Adding Friends

Adding friends is another exciting part of Discord, which is luckily very straightforward. Follow the easy guide to do so.

In the "Friends" tab, you can see options on the dashboard. Click on the green "Add friend" button to add someone. A screen will appear that will ask you to enter a friend's username and #number. Press the "Send Friend Request" option after this, and you would have added your first friend!

You can find your username along with the number at the bottom of your dashboard, which you can let a friend know who wants to add you.

**Conclusion**

As you would've already gathered from above, Discord is a very cool and useful app. It is not just meant for communication but to also build a social platform where you can meet other people and form communities around the same interests.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Discord

#### 1\. Why Is Discord So Popular?

Discord offers good basic functionality for free, while the full version is pretty affordable as well. The chat is ad-free, which gives youngsters the ability to be part of their favorite gaming communities.

#### 2\. Is It Safe To Use Discord?

Use appropriate monitoring and privacy settings to ensure that your Discord is safe. However, to be more careful, only accept friend requests from the people you know.

#### 3\. Is It Free To Use Discord?

If you don't want premium features, you can download and use Discord for free on your devices.
