Regarding the origin, Discord allows you and different individuals to text each other. Here, almost every group is named a "server." All in all, it's more of a standard version of Slack for ease of understanding.

In this guide, you will gather all the cool and funny Discord names collected and crafted after an intensive amount of research.
