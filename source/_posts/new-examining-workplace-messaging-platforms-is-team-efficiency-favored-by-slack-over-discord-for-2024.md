## Examining Workplace Messaging Platforms: Is Team Efficiency Favored by Slack over Discord?

# Slack Vs. Discord: Which Is Better for Your Team

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

[Discord](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)is popular among gamers as they use it to connect with team members, stream their play, and interact within the community.

Though, that is not to say that Discord is useless for non-gaming purposes.

[Slack](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)offers a pretty similar scope of use to Discord as a group chat application. However, it only caters to working individuals looking to liaison for projects and communicate effortlessly for work-related tasks.

Although they may be similar in a lot of ways, which is better for your needs? Let's compare them in detail and find out!

## Part 1: Discord Vs. Slack Pricing

Pricing is where Slack takes a hit. If you're low on budget, Discord is definitely a better option. Slack users must pay for a subscription, with the plans starting from $6.67 per month for simple features, such as removing the limit of 10,000 searchable messages and 10 integrations.

For extended features, such as guest access, 99.99% uptime, and 24/7 customer care, customers will have to shell out $12.5 per month.

In contrast, Discord offers **free access** to users with pretty much no limitations. Users can keep their team's message history in the free version and generally access most of the features.

However, if you want extra perks, such as higher screen sharing quality, extras space, or [animated emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can subscribe to the [Discord Nitro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) plan. **Slack vs. Discord has a clear winner if you're only considering the price point: Discord!**

![Discord Nitro Pricing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-pricing.jpg)

_Discord has a Nitro plan that provides unfiltered service, whereas it is still completely usable without it._

![Slack  Pricing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-pricing.jpg)

_Slack has various limits to features on three different levels_

## Part 2: Discord Vs. Slack Interface

Both apps share many similarities in their template and interface. Users will find their contacts on the left and conversations on the right on both apps.

However, Slack's interface is much more user-friendly and concise, with all the DMs, apps, and channels visible on the right.

In contrast, users might be initially thrown off by Discord due to its more complicated nature. If they want to access channels and direct messages, they will have to find them through different menus.

But compared to Slack, users will find it easier to customize their [Discord profile](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). They can add different theme colors and a light mode.

Slack's customization options also offer variety, but applying the changes can be quite cumbersome because of the complicated format. Discord is more intuitive when compared to Slack in terms of use.

Also, what you see as servers in Discord are essentially teams in Slack, and switching teams in Slack is more complicated than changing Discord servers.

![Discord interface   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-interface.jpg)

Lastly, when using Discord, you can join and leave servers at will, while you will have to go through an onboarding process for each team in Slack.

![Slack  interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-preferences-settings.jpg)

Slack vs. Discord is so hotly contested because of their similarities, and the interface is the biggest one of them all!

## Part 3: Discord Vs. Slack Conversations

Slack gives users the liberty to communicate in various ways, including direct messages, public conversations, and private channels.

In contrast, Discord channels only allow for communication using text and voice. Channel [members can be assigned specific roles,](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and users can also communicate via private channels.

Moreover, Slack does not have an official limit for team members, while Discord does have a server limit of 500,000 members.

If the number of online members exceeds 250,000, users need to contact Discord support for extra server space.

**Image**: _Discord (left) and Slack (right) also have a very similar way to send direct messages to various accounts_

## Part 4: Slack Vs. Discord Video Call

Discord is known for its [voice calls](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), allowing users to access special voice channels to just join and start speaking.

![Discord Video call   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg)

This feature is desirable to gamers who want to interact with friends in between games. Users can speak to 5,000 people simultaneously and see up to 9 friends at a time.

In contrast, Slack offers quite basic video calling features, missing out on crucial features like noise suspension and echo cancellation, which Discord offers.

Also, Discord offers a push-to-talk feature where users can turn their mics on during gaming sessions.

![Slack Video Conferencing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-video-conferencing.jpg)

_On Discord (left), the video call hub will drop down from the top, whereas, on Slack (left), the hub appears in the middle of the screen_

Both of these apps do not feature built-in voice messaging. Slack does offer the luxury of recording voice messages, but that requires third-party integration. Discord completely misses out on this feature.

If we were to rate the two apps for video calling features, **Discord seems to come out on top, offering many advanced features for its users.**

## Part 5: Discord Vs. Slack File Sharing

Users can share files on both Discord and Slack, with the size limit of files being the main difference.

With Discord, users can share files up to 8MB, but upgrading to the Nitro plan increases this limit to 15MB. In contrast, Slack allows users to share files up to 1GB.

However, Slack users cannot save these shared files forever, while Discord allows their users to save unlimited messages and file history.

This feature is handy if users need to access the files they shared in the past. They can also subscribe to the Nitro plan for longer backlogs and get a 50MB limit per file instead of the 8MB in the free version.

![Discord screensharing   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-screen-sharing-friends.jpg)

With Slack, users can even share Google Drive, along with code and text snippets, which is a valuable feature for business and work-related file-sharing.

In contrast, users can only share files from their own device on Discord. However, it is necessary to confirm before sharing files in both apps, which can be cumbersome for large file transfers.

![Slack screensharing   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-screen-sharing.jpg)

_The file-sharing prompt on Discord (left) and Slack (right) is also somewhat similar, with both providing instant sharing by holding down the Shift button_

## Part 6: Discord Vs. Slack Screen Sharing

Slack restricts video calls to two people, except for users who have subscribed to an extension plan. For paid users, the limit extends to 15 people.

It allows anyone to share their screen on a video call, regardless of their payment plan, and users can access both video and voice calls with the same button.

Discord also allows users to [share their screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with other members, giving them the luxury to share their entire screen, a particular window, or gameplay with up to 9 people at a time, without making any changes to the settings.

**Image**: _The screen sharing tools on Discord (Left) are more descriptive and provide more options than those for Slack (Left)_

## Part 7: Discord Vs. Slack Summary

When it comes to video calling and file-sharing, both apps can boast their qualities, catering to different target audiences and serving various purposes.

Discord prioritizes voice chat, where gamers can communicate with their friends while playing games. Slack is more business-centric as it emphasizes text chat, file transfers, and project collaboration, with a slightly more formal structure.

If you're looking for a more social-media-oriented network, where you can communicate with your peers easily in an informal manner, Discord is the right app for you. It is a dream for gamers, and now even for people collaborating at work!

However, if you're looking for an app that caters more to work-related purposes, with a large number of integrations, and a text-oriented layout, Slack will serve you well. It's an adequate team chat app for businesses and organizations.

At the end of the day, **Slack vs. Discord** is a fight whose victor is down to the user. What app you choose depends on your purpose and the goal you want to achieve.

And although Discord is well-placed to be the future of communications, as it stands, some gamers use Slack, and some businessmen use Discord. So, there's no saying that one app serves only one specific purpose.

In contrast, Discord channels only allow for communication using text and voice. Channel [members can be assigned specific roles,](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and users can also communicate via private channels.

Moreover, Slack does not have an official limit for team members, while Discord does have a server limit of 500,000 members.

If the number of online members exceeds 250,000, users need to contact Discord support for extra server space.

**Image**: _Discord (left) and Slack (right) also have a very similar way to send direct messages to various accounts_

## Part 4: Slack Vs. Discord Video Call

Discord is known for its [voice calls](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), allowing users to access special voice channels to just join and start speaking.

![Discord Video call   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg)

This feature is desirable to gamers who want to interact with friends in between games. Users can speak to 5,000 people simultaneously and see up to 9 friends at a time.

In contrast, Slack offers quite basic video calling features, missing out on crucial features like noise suspension and echo cancellation, which Discord offers.

Also, Discord offers a push-to-talk feature where users can turn their mics on during gaming sessions.

![Slack Video Conferencing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-video-conferencing.jpg)

_On Discord (left), the video call hub will drop down from the top, whereas, on Slack (left), the hub appears in the middle of the screen_

Both of these apps do not feature built-in voice messaging. Slack does offer the luxury of recording voice messages, but that requires third-party integration. Discord completely misses out on this feature.

If we were to rate the two apps for video calling features, **Discord seems to come out on top, offering many advanced features for its users.**

## Part 5: Discord Vs. Slack File Sharing

Users can share files on both Discord and Slack, with the size limit of files being the main difference.

With Discord, users can share files up to 8MB, but upgrading to the Nitro plan increases this limit to 15MB. In contrast, Slack allows users to share files up to 1GB.

However, Slack users cannot save these shared files forever, while Discord allows their users to save unlimited messages and file history.

This feature is handy if users need to access the files they shared in the past. They can also subscribe to the Nitro plan for longer backlogs and get a 50MB limit per file instead of the 8MB in the free version.

![Discord screensharing   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-screen-sharing-friends.jpg)

With Slack, users can even share Google Drive, along with code and text snippets, which is a valuable feature for business and work-related file-sharing.

In contrast, users can only share files from their own device on Discord. However, it is necessary to confirm before sharing files in both apps, which can be cumbersome for large file transfers.

![Slack screensharing   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-screen-sharing.jpg)

_The file-sharing prompt on Discord (left) and Slack (right) is also somewhat similar, with both providing instant sharing by holding down the Shift button_

## Part 6: Discord Vs. Slack Screen Sharing

Slack restricts video calls to two people, except for users who have subscribed to an extension plan. For paid users, the limit extends to 15 people.

It allows anyone to share their screen on a video call, regardless of their payment plan, and users can access both video and voice calls with the same button.

Discord also allows users to [share their screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with other members, giving them the luxury to share their entire screen, a particular window, or gameplay with up to 9 people at a time, without making any changes to the settings.

**Image**: _The screen sharing tools on Discord (Left) are more descriptive and provide more options than those for Slack (Left)_

## Part 7: Discord Vs. Slack Summary

When it comes to video calling and file-sharing, both apps can boast their qualities, catering to different target audiences and serving various purposes.

Discord prioritizes voice chat, where gamers can communicate with their friends while playing games. Slack is more business-centric as it emphasizes text chat, file transfers, and project collaboration, with a slightly more formal structure.

If you're looking for a more social-media-oriented network, where you can communicate with your peers easily in an informal manner, Discord is the right app for you. It is a dream for gamers, and now even for people collaborating at work!

However, if you're looking for an app that caters more to work-related purposes, with a large number of integrations, and a text-oriented layout, Slack will serve you well. It's an adequate team chat app for businesses and organizations.

At the end of the day, **Slack vs. Discord** is a fight whose victor is down to the user. What app you choose depends on your purpose and the goal you want to achieve.

And although Discord is well-placed to be the future of communications, as it stands, some gamers use Slack, and some businessmen use Discord. So, there's no saying that one app serves only one specific purpose.

## Unveiling the Power of Pinning: Your Guide to Discord Mastery

# How to Pin A Message on Discord?

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Like TeamSpeak or Skype, Discord is a chat app aimed at easy mass communication. Although it was made for gamers, it is readily used for communicating in offices, during projects, or for professional collaboration.

Even though it's straightforward to use, there are several Discord features that you may be unfamiliar with.

One such feature is called pinning messages. It is available to moderators, administrators, server owners, and other users who have permission to "Manage Messages" in various server channels.

This feature helps you find and share vital messages quickly, especially when new users join a specific channel.

It acts like a sticky note for Discord, making sure valuable information such as server rules do not get overshadowed by new messages even months after the pinned messages are first posted.

Today, we will go over how to pin a message on Discord for your desktop app on PC and Mac, as well as on your iPhone and Android mobile devices.

## Part 1: How to Pin A Message on Discord Desktop?

If you want to learn how to pin messages on Discord desktop, follow these steps:

1. Hover over any message which you wish to pin.
2. On the right-hand side of it, there will be a button that would read as More; click it and you will see a screen like below

![ Pin message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pin-messages-on-discord.jpg)

1. Now, click on the "Pin Message" option
2. After which, you will be presented with a prompt asking you to confirm that you want to pin this particular message. Click on "Oh yeah, pin it."

![ Pin message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/double-check-pin-messages.jpg)

That's it! You have now learned how to pin messages on Discord for the desktop application.

But make sure you don't pin everything that might seem important at a glance â€” only pin messages that may have utility in the future.

Also, don't pin messages that are just important for you. In larger channels, prioritize pinning messages that will benefit most participants.

## Part 2: How to Pin Messages on Discord Mobile App?

Pinning messages in the mobile app is very similar to how it is done on the desktop application. Do it by:

1. Just hold down your finger on the message you wish to pin
2. A couple of seconds later, you will be presented with a list of options
3. From here, click on "Pin Message"

![ Pin message on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pin-message-on-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. A pop-up will appear confirming if you want to pin the message. If you are sure you want to pin a particular message, tap the "Yes" button and then your message is pinned

## Part 3: How to View Pinned Messages on Discord

Accessing pinned messages is just as easy as pinning them. To access a pinned message on the app's desktop version:

1. Click on the pin icon appearing on the top right-hand side of your screen

![view Pinned message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-pinned-message.jpg)

1. Doing this will present you with a drop-down list of pinned messages. Now, you can tap on the "Jump" button next to the "x" (cross) icon to go directly to the pinned message
2. This will allow you to understand the context behind the pinned message. You can also access and share links in the pinned messages from here

## Part 4: How to View Pinned Messages on Discord Mobile

View your pins on the mobile version of Discord by:

1. Swiping from right to left, which will open up a side menu
2. Then click on "Pins," which is the second option from the left, as shown in the picture below

![view Pinned message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-pinned-message-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Now you will be in the pinned messages window
2. You can jump to a specific pinned message by clicking on it, allowing you to access any content or links in the message

## Part 5: Limit on Pinned Messages

You can only pin 50 messages in the pin box in Discord, meaning if you want to pin new messages, you will have to delete older ones to make space.

This may feel like a disadvantage. However, it makes perfect sense. Pinning messages is only for important information that must be used in the future.

Removing this limit and giving people free rein on the number of messages they can pin will eventually lead to too many pinned messages, defeating the feature's purpose.

## Part 6: How to Delete Pinned Messages on Discord?

If something pinned in the past has become redundant over time, you can remove it from the pinned messages.

This will make sure your pinned messages do not stockpile over time, and there is space to add new messages important to the server.

To remove pinned messages on desktops:

1. Go to the pin icon used to access pins
2. Next, hover over the message you wish to unpin and click on the "x" (cross) button next to the jump button
3. After this, click on the "yeah, remove it please kthx" button
4. The message will now stop appearing in the list of pinned messages

To do the same for mobile devices:

1. Swipe right to left to access the side menu
2. Click on "Pins" to view all the messages pinned by you or other people on the server with permissions to pin
3. Then hold down on the message, which will give you an option to unpin it
4. Click on "Unpin" to remove the message from the list of pinned messages

**Things to keep in mind**:

* You can skip the pop-up shown above when trying to remove a pinned message. All you must do is hold shift when clicking on the "x" (cross) button allowing you to go on that spree of unpins
* Another thing to remember is that all these tips on how pin messages apply to both Direct Messages (DM) and Server group chats

#### All in All

Learning how to pin a message on Discord could be a little tricky at first, mostly if you haven't done so in the past and someone spontaneously asks you to do so.

However, the feature is pretty intuitive and straightforward once you get the hang of it.

The usefulness of pinning makes it very important for both old and new users as you can relay important information without having to go through tons of old messages.
