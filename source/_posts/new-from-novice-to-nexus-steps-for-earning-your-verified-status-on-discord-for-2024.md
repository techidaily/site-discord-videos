 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Since the pandemic, communication-based social media websites have become even more popular; be it Instagram, Twitter, or Discord; they have amassed millions of users.

Some of these users are credible organizations, companies, celebrities, or other revered personalities. And they are usually given verified accounts. The mark of a verified account is the tiny blue tick next to the name.

People strive for this blue tick because it makes their account seem “official”; other users don’t mind sharing from and sharing with these accounts.

Once users know that a specific social media account is a verified one, they would never hesitate to interact with them.

If you want that kind of reverence for your online presence, keep reading as we elaborate on **how to get verified on Discord**:

#### In this article

* [Part 1: How to Get Verified On Discord](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Apply For Discord Partnership](#part2)
* [Part 3: Differences Between Discord Verification And Partnership](#part3)

## Part 1: How to Get Verified On Discord

Verification on social media sites is most often used as proving your identity when you are a semi-famous or famous individual.

However, unlike the variety of other social media platforms, Discord does not verify just about anyone with a large following.

Presently, verification on Discord is limited to publishers and game developers, Spotify verified musical artists, and professional e-sports teams with massive followers and monthly listeners.

Suppose you are a content creator on YouTube, Twitch, or Reddit. In that case, you can also apply for Discord Partnership, which is an alternative account identification form.

Therefore, read on as we discuss **how to get verified on Discord**:

### Requirements Of Getting Verified On Discord

If you want to get verified on Discord, here are all the things you need to know about the application and qualification process:

* You must be a server owner and be the official representative of a group, team, or individual applying
* The server being verified must also meet the [community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) of Discord
* If you do not fall into any of the categories mentioned above, you cannot be verified on Discord
* However, if you do meet the criteria, you would have to go to [discordapp.com/verification](https://discord.com/verification) and click on “Apply Now”
* Applicants are also required to provide an associated email address, along with the supplementary information proving their identity

Suppose you do not fit into the Discord verification criteria, but you are a streamer or a content creator. In that case, you can apply for your server to become a Discord Partner.

## Part 2: How to Apply For Discord Partnership

Recently there was a change in the Discord Partner Program, rewarding more active servers instead of the server owners with a large following outside of Discord.

For eligibility in the Discord Partner Program, the server in question must meet the Activity Requirements that are listed in the Partner Program portion of Server Insights.

You must keep in mind that partnership is not automatic, and you must fill out an application. Discord can also remove your partnership at any time if the requirements mentioned above are not met for a prolonged period.

### Requirements For Partner Discord Servers

The Discord partner program provides engaged and well-moderated servers with the extra tools and recognition to re-invest in the community. The accepted servers also get additional benefits and perks.

![Get Certified on Discord - Enable Discord Community Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-discord-community-interface.jpg)

Before submitting your Partner application, you would need to check the server engagement requirements.

The servers thinking of applying to the Partner program have to be marked as “Community” servers in the Server Settings, allowing access to Server Insights.

![How to Get Certified on Discord - Discord Partner Program](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-partner-program.jpg)

The Server Insights will help you look at how close you are to applying to the Discord Partner Program.

You can also track the progress towards unlocking your Partner Program application anytime inside the Server Insights and the in-app Partner page.

Once you attain access to this page, there are specific server requirements that you would have to reach:

* The server must be a minimum of eight weeks old
* You must have a minimum of 500 members on your server
* Have a minimum of fifty communicators, people actively talking on your server per week
* Have a minimum of a hundred participators, people visiting/viewing your server per week
* Have a minimum of 20% Week 1 retention over a period of 8 weeks
* You must have enabled the two-factor authentication requirement for Server Moderation. This can be found in the Server Settings and then going to Moderation

Once you are a Discord Partner, you will get access to the VIP features mentioned below:

* You will receive a banner for your server
* You will receive an animated server icon
* The server and the server owner will receive a Discord Partner badge
* The server owner will receive a subscription to Discord Nitro throughout the partnership
* The partnered server also receives a customizable vanity invite URL

## Part 3: Differences Between Discord Verification And Partnership

**Discord verification** goes to servers that are run by brands, figures of public interest, and businesses. A verified badge shows the official home of that community.

Acceptance into the **Discord Verification** program only gives you server access to the Vanity URL, Verified Server badge, and the invite splash background.

In contrast, the Partner program provides a server banner, animated server icon, Nitro subscription, and a Discord Partner badge.

Furthermore, the Discord Partner Program aims to reward engaged, quality servers by providing them with extra tools and recognition, helping them invest further into their community.

A partner badge next to a server’s name indicates that it is one of the most engaging and reliable communities on Discord.

You might be thinking, can I be Discord Verified and Discord Partner at the same time? The answer is yes, you can.

If you are qualified for both programs, you can be in them. A Discord Verified server could send its application to the Discord Partner Program when they satisfy Partner Program requirements.

Lastly, if a server is removed from one of the programs, it can still be in the other one. Like, suppose a server is both Verified and Partnered but loses its Partnership. In that case, it can still stay verified and enjoy all the added benefits of **Discord Verification**.

## Frequently Asked Question about Getting Verification on Discord

#### Question 1: How long will it take to complete verification on Discord?

Answer: Generally, it would take around 5 business day to complete the verfication. However, the time may varies depend on the amount of application.

_Soure: Discord Support_

#### Question 2: Will I get charged for getting my server verified?

Answer: No. You won't be charged for getting your Discord server verified.

#### Question: Can I apply verification if our server is run by fan?

Answer: No, fan server can not be verified.

# How to Send Videos on Discord

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The whole point of Discord is to bring together communities of like-minded people to talk, share ideas and have fun together. And this isn’t just limited to chatting but sometimes you’re going to want to share content, including videos.

So, whether it’s a compilation of your best gaming moments that you’ve carefully edited together, a home movie that you want to share with friends, or just a funny clip that someone’s sent you that you want to pass on, here we’ll take you through how to send videos on Discord both on PC and mobile, and the likely issues you might face.

* [Part 1: How to Send Videos on Discord PC](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Send Videos on Discord Mobile](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Send Long Videos on Discord That Are More Than 8MB](#part3)
* [Part 4: FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord](#part4)

## Part 1: How to Send Videos on Discord PC

It’s actually pretty simple to send videos on Discord when using a PC, providing they aren’t too large a file size.

Firstly, you just need to navigate to the channel or private message where you want to send the video. Just find the right option on the list of servers you’re a member of, or head to your message inbox to find the user you want to send it to privately.

Once you’re in the right place, click on the plus (+) icon that you’ll find to the left of the chatbox at the bottom of the screen where you’d normally type your message.

You’ll then just need to find the file on your computer, and double click on it. It’ll then bring up a pop-up for the video where you can add a comment, which will sit above the video (ideal if you need to give context on why you’re sharing it). You can also mark it as a spoiler – useful if you’re sharing a gaming tip but you don’t want to spoil the story for anyone who’s not reached that point yet.

![upload videos to discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/upload-video-discord-1.png)

From there, it’s as simple as clicking the upload button. Once it’s ready, the video will be in the chat window for anyone in the server to watch, or for your friend if you’ve sent it privately. And if they want to download it, they’ll just need to click the download button (a downward-facing arrow) at the top right of the video.

![how to upload videos to discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/upload-video-discord-2.png)

It’s worth noting that, while Discord will play most video formats, it can’t manage everything. If you upload a format that Discord isn’t compatible with, then it won’t show a video player – instead, the file will just be uploaded. Other people can still download it to watch on their own devices.

Also, there’s a strict file limit of 8MB. This isn’t huge at all – while there’s no definitive file size for video (as it depends on file type, resolution, compression, etc) it’s unlikely to be more than 60 seconds of footage, and could just be a few seconds. If the video you want to upload is more than 8MB, carry on reading below to find out how.

## Part 2: How to Send Videos on Discord Mobile

The process to send video on Discord Mobile is pretty similar both with iOS and Android, but with just a few minor tweaks.

Firstly, you still need to navigate to either the server or inbox where you want to share the video. You can then click the ‘Photo Selector’ button directly to the left of the chatbox.

This will open your phone’s gallery, but it’ll only be searching for photos. You instead want the File Selector, which will be the third icon along – it looks like a text document with a folded-over corner.

Click this and it’ll give you the option to directly upload a video from your phone’s Downloads folder. To send a video that’s stored elsewhere, click on the Expand arrow at the top left of the menu. This will send you to your phone’s file navigation system where you can find the video you want.

Once you’ve selected the video, just hit the blue Send icon to send your video to the chat. Again you can add a message as a caption, but this time it’ll just be in the normal message box rather than a dedicated comment box before you hit upload.

## Part 3: How to Send Long Videos on Discord That Are More Than 8MB

So as we’ve said above, there is a file size limit when you’re using a free Discord account of just 8MB, which isn’t much at all. There are a few ways around this, so take your pick from the one that sounds best for you.

#### 1\. Update to Discord Nitro to Upload 100MB

The first option is possibly the simplest but it’s definitely not the cheapest, and that’s to pay for an upgrade to Discord Nitro. The paid version of Discord has a number of benefits, one of which is the increased file upload size of 100MB. It costs $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, so if you’re likely to be regularly uploading videos that are lower than this limit, it might make sense.

#### 2\. Cut Unwanted Clips/Compress Video with Filmora Video Editor

The second choice would be to take your video and cut it into pieces, sending them one at a time. This might sound time-consuming but with Filmora’s Instant Cutter Tool, it’s really simple.

All you need to do is open a video in Filmora by clicking the arrow next to Import and then choosing ‘Import with Instant Cutter Tool’.

This will open the Instant Cutter window where you can click Open File to add your video. From here you can trim your files and export them in multiple sections. There are different ways that you can do this, and while each is a simple process, there are still a few steps to follow.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For more detail, check out [this post](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for a step-by-step guide on the different ways you can trim a video in Filmora.

You can also try to compress your video size, which may let you keep the whole video at the expense of some of the quality. Again, using Filmora, this is easy. But also again, there are different ways to go about it.

You could literally crop the video in order to trim some of the data, as the reduced viewing screen won’t be as big a file. You can also reduce the resolution, or convert your video to a format that uses fewer data. You’ll need to test it though, as converting to some video formats might result in blurry footage.

There are advanced settings you can tinker with too, such as lowering the frame rate or the bit rate. Again, rather than go through all of those options in an epic article here, it’s easier to head to a post dedicated to these steps about [compress videos with Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 3\. Upload to YouTube/Vimeo/Google Drive/Dropbox

The final option is to upload your video to an online player or storage site, and link to it, rather than having Discord host the file. YouTube and Vimeo are the obvious options, but Streamable is another popular choice too with a free membership. YouTube’s maximum video uploads are 128GB, which is huge, while other sites like Streamable cap free accounts to 500MB per video.

So, if you want to upload massive files, you’ll need to decide whether to choose YouTube or pay for an upgraded membership elsewhere. Wherever you host your video, once it’s online just grab the link and paste it into Discord to share your content.

The only drawback to this option is that it stops other users from being able to download the video directly, and you may need to look at a file sharing alternative such as Dropbox if you want to send the actual file.

## FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord

#### Which Kind of Video Formats Can I Upload to Discord?

You can send any filetype to another user on Discord, so that they can download it and watch it on their own device. But if you want to upload a video so that Discord embeds it, and makes it playable within the chat, you’re limited to only mp4 and WebM filetypes.

You can also use MOV files, but not everyone will be able to play them, and FLAC files are supported on desktop only but not on mobile.

#### How Can I Upload Saved Videos to Discord?

If you find a video on Discord that you want to share on a different server or in a private DM, you can use the download icon to save it locally. Then, follow the steps above to upload the video to the server or DM chat window where you want to share it.

The whole point of Discord is to bring together communities of like-minded people to talk, share ideas and have fun together. And this isn’t just limited to chatting but sometimes you’re going to want to share content, including videos.

So, whether it’s a compilation of your best gaming moments that you’ve carefully edited together, a home movie that you want to share with friends, or just a funny clip that someone’s sent you that you want to pass on, here we’ll take you through how to send videos on Discord both on PC and mobile, and the likely issues you might face.

* [Part 4: FAQs About Uploading Videos to Discord](#part4)

## Part 1: How to Send Videos on Discord PC

It’s actually pretty simple to send videos on Discord when using a PC, providing they aren’t too large a file size.

Firstly, you just need to navigate to the channel or private message where you want to send the video. Just find the right option on the list of servers you’re a member of, or head to your message inbox to find the user you want to send it to privately.

Once you’re in the right place, click on the plus (+) icon that you’ll find to the left of the chatbox at the bottom of the screen where you’d normally type your message.

You’ll then just need to find the file on your computer, and double click on it. It’ll then bring up a pop-up for the video where you can add a comment, which will sit above the video (ideal if you need to give context on why you’re sharing it). You can also mark it as a spoiler – useful if you’re sharing a gaming tip but you don’t want to spoil the story for anyone who’s not reached that point yet.

![upload videos to discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/upload-video-discord-1.png)

From there, it’s as simple as clicking the upload button. Once it’s ready, the video will be in the chat window for anyone in the server to watch, or for your friend if you’ve sent it privately. And if they want to download it, they’ll just need to click the download button (a downward-facing arrow) at the top right of the video.

![how to upload videos to discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/upload-video-discord-2.png)

It’s worth noting that, while Discord will play most video formats, it can’t manage everything. If you upload a format that Discord isn’t compatible with, then it won’t show a video player – instead, the file will just be uploaded. Other people can still download it to watch on their own devices.

Also, there’s a strict file limit of 8MB. This isn’t huge at all – while there’s no definitive file size for video (as it depends on file type, resolution, compression, etc) it’s unlikely to be more than 60 seconds of footage, and could just be a few seconds. If the video you want to upload is more than 8MB, carry on reading below to find out how.
