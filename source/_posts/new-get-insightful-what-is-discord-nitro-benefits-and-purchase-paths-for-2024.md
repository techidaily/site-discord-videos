The premium subscription service for Discord is known as Discord Nitro! Want to learn more about it? Read on as we elaborate.

## Part 1: What Is Discord Nitro And What Does It Do?

Discord is absolutely free, but you may require a Discord Nitro subscription if you want to use its more powerful features! At this point, you may be wondering, what does Discord Nitro do?

Though upgrading is not a requirement as most features do not require a subscription, free users still have certain limitations.

![ Discord Nitro pricing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-pricing.jpg)

For instance, they can’t use the same emojis on two servers. In addition to that, the streaming quality and account customization features also lack on the free plan. These features and more are strictly for Discord Nitro users only.

Apart from the fact that Discord Nitro offers better additional features, it also lets users help their preferred servers and unlock various features.

## Part 2: Why Should People Use The Discord Nitro?

With the discord free version, you can do many things: **communicate with your friend outside and inside of games, start your server, and even participate in various channels**.

For some, these features are more than adequate; for others, they aren’t! They want more capabilities, and Discord Nitro provides them exactly with that.

However, most of these new features are cosmetic.

For instance, **you can make and use your custom emojis if you’re an emoji admirer. Not only this, but you can also use animated emojis, including GIFs**.

![ Discord Nitro benefits](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-benefits.jpg)

Without further ado, here are a few key benefits you’ll get with Discord Nitro:

### Better Emojis

We all know how vital emojis have become for healthy chitchats, even to the extent that no conversation seems complete if you don’t have an emoji in it.

**Discord Nitro allows you to collect and create your customized emojis**. Usually, these emojis are animated and easily used while chatting with other Discord users.

### Personal Profile

Since your personal profile is your only Discord identity, make sure to customize it with animated avatars and claim custom tags to get going.

### Better Animation

With Discord Nitro, you can also unblock various GIF avatars and custom tags.

### High-Definition (HD) Screen Sharing

You can share the game screen on the server or with friends and other users with Discord Nitro. Choose from 720p and 1080p at 30fps.

### Fancy Badge

One of the better additions for several Discord users is getting the latest, fancy badge. **With Discord Nitro, you can earn new badges to display on your personal profile**.

## Part 3: How Much Does Discord Nitro Cost?

Free Discord users can choose from two variants if they want to switch to Discord Nitro premium services.

You can choose between annual or monthly subscription plans. And if you pick a yearly subscription plan, you’ll get a 16% discount.

The two Discord Nitro variants are Nitro Classic and Nitro!

If you choose the Nitro classic subscription service, you’ll have to pay $4.99 on the monthly plan or $49.99 annually. This variant is comparatively cheaper than the Nitro and provides stripped-down features.

On the other hand, if you go for the Nitro subscription service, get ready to pay $99.99 on the yearly plan and $9.99 on the monthly. It offers many features to its users.

Both these variants provide loads of advantages to discord users; here are a handful of benefits the two paid subscription services offer:

* If you choose the free version, your screen share settings typically max out at the 720p resolution (30fps). However, if you select either of the two paid versions, you can share a screen with friends at 720p (60fps) resolution or 1080p resolution (30fps)
* Go-Live provides users with limited streaming; it means you can stream games to users who don’t happen to be your friends, unlike screen-share. So, with a free version, you can stream at 720p (30fps), whereas, Nitro Classic subscription will allow you to stream up to 1080p resolution (60fps), and the Nitro will provide you with 60fps and more quality
* With the free version, you can upload and share only 8MB size files. But with paid variants, you’ll get an increased uploading limit. For example, Nitro Classic allows an upload limit up to 50MB, while the Nitro goes a step further and allows 100MB
* Users of both paid versions will get a badge which will be displayed with their usernames
* You can upgrade your image to an animated GIF!
* With paid subscriptions, you can create customized usernames and emojis to enhance your experience

One significant difference between the Nitro and Nitro Classic versions is the difference between their server boost capability.

Server boost is a user-gifted advantage that paid subscribers can provide to server owners to unlock extra perks for other users. The Nitro service has two server boosts, unlike the Nitro Classic service.

## Part 1: What Is Discord Nitro And What Does It Do?

Discord is absolutely free, but you may require a Discord Nitro subscription if you want to use its more powerful features! At this point, you may be wondering, what does Discord Nitro do?

Though upgrading is not a requirement as most features do not require a subscription, free users still have certain limitations.

![ Discord Nitro pricing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-pricing.jpg)

For instance, they can’t use the same emojis on two servers. In addition to that, the streaming quality and account customization features also lack on the free plan. These features and more are strictly for Discord Nitro users only.

Apart from the fact that Discord Nitro offers better additional features, it also lets users help their preferred servers and unlock various features.

## Part 2: Why Should People Use The Discord Nitro?

With the discord free version, you can do many things: **communicate with your friend outside and inside of games, start your server, and even participate in various channels**.

For some, these features are more than adequate; for others, they aren’t! They want more capabilities, and Discord Nitro provides them exactly with that.

However, most of these new features are cosmetic.

For instance, **you can make and use your custom emojis if you’re an emoji admirer. Not only this, but you can also use animated emojis, including GIFs**.

![ Discord Nitro benefits](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-benefits.jpg)

Without further ado, here are a few key benefits you’ll get with Discord Nitro:

### Better Emojis

We all know how vital emojis have become for healthy chitchats, even to the extent that no conversation seems complete if you don’t have an emoji in it.

**Discord Nitro allows you to collect and create your customized emojis**. Usually, these emojis are animated and easily used while chatting with other Discord users.

### Personal Profile

Since your personal profile is your only Discord identity, make sure to customize it with animated avatars and claim custom tags to get going.

### Better Animation

With Discord Nitro, you can also unblock various GIF avatars and custom tags.

### High-Definition (HD) Screen Sharing

You can share the game screen on the server or with friends and other users with Discord Nitro. Choose from 720p and 1080p at 30fps.

### Fancy Badge

One of the better additions for several Discord users is getting the latest, fancy badge. **With Discord Nitro, you can earn new badges to display on your personal profile**.

## Part 3: How Much Does Discord Nitro Cost?

Free Discord users can choose from two variants if they want to switch to Discord Nitro premium services.

You can choose between annual or monthly subscription plans. And if you pick a yearly subscription plan, you’ll get a 16% discount.

The two Discord Nitro variants are Nitro Classic and Nitro!

If you choose the Nitro classic subscription service, you’ll have to pay $4.99 on the monthly plan or $49.99 annually. This variant is comparatively cheaper than the Nitro and provides stripped-down features.

On the other hand, if you go for the Nitro subscription service, get ready to pay $99.99 on the yearly plan and $9.99 on the monthly. It offers many features to its users.

Both these variants provide loads of advantages to discord users; here are a handful of benefits the two paid subscription services offer:

* If you choose the free version, your screen share settings typically max out at the 720p resolution (30fps). However, if you select either of the two paid versions, you can share a screen with friends at 720p (60fps) resolution or 1080p resolution (30fps)
* Go-Live provides users with limited streaming; it means you can stream games to users who don’t happen to be your friends, unlike screen-share. So, with a free version, you can stream at 720p (30fps), whereas, Nitro Classic subscription will allow you to stream up to 1080p resolution (60fps), and the Nitro will provide you with 60fps and more quality
* With the free version, you can upload and share only 8MB size files. But with paid variants, you’ll get an increased uploading limit. For example, Nitro Classic allows an upload limit up to 50MB, while the Nitro goes a step further and allows 100MB
* Users of both paid versions will get a badge which will be displayed with their usernames
* You can upgrade your image to an animated GIF!
* With paid subscriptions, you can create customized usernames and emojis to enhance your experience

One significant difference between the Nitro and Nitro Classic versions is the difference between their server boost capability.

Server boost is a user-gifted advantage that paid subscribers can provide to server owners to unlock extra perks for other users. The Nitro service has two server boosts, unlike the Nitro Classic service.

## Part 4: How to Subscribe to Discord Nitro?

Looking at the perks you get if you become a paid Discord member, it’s evident that several users will want to avail the opportunity. Especially with the number of streamers and gamers increasing every day!

But how does one upgrade to Discord Nitro?

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord is a brand name that many people have heard about, and this instant messaging and content distribution service is rapidly gaining popularity among many groups of users. A unique feature of this platform is that it facilitates community-based communication, where users who share certain interests can form their own private chats that are known as servers.

While its user interface is quite simple, Discord allows users to deploy a variety of advanced communication tools, from textual content to audio and video streams. It’s natural that users want to express their thoughts creatively, so there is a lot of genuine interest in learning how to change the visual look of the messages through the use of basic text formatting. In this article, we will discuss how to change text style in Discord and provide detailed instructions for activating various options, such as using bold or italic letters or underlining a part of the text.

Let’s start with the software module that makes it all possible.

## Part 1: How Does Discord Text Engine Work?

Beneath the surface, Discord runs on a powerful engine called Markdown, which regulates how text is displayed on the pages visible to users. It’s an application of markup language that completely depends on textual symbols as commands, making it quite simple for users who are not skilled at advanced programming to alter the look of the text.

Basically, Markdown allows you to enter a few symbols and it will interpret them as commands for changing the text style, for example bolding or underlying certain word or sentence. For highlighting blocks of text, there is a specific library named [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) that allows simple text marking for stylistic emphasis.

This approach is very practical and easy to learn, so long-time users of Discord are able to change text style as they type without thinking too much about it. Really, it’s all about following a couple of simple rules and knowing the most important combinations of characters (tags).

## Part 2: How to Change Text Style in Discord with Markdown?

As we mentioned previously, Markdown is completely text-based and has a very simple syntax. All you need to do to apply special formatting to your text is to enter a few special characters at the right places, and the appropriate effect (bold, italic…) will appear in the chat. Keep in mind that you can easily combine the formatting styles by using multiple commands at the same time.

Here is an overview of the most important options for changing text style in Discord, and you can preview the text style in real time before sending to friends:

![Change Text Style in Discord  - Basic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-change-text-style.jpg)

#### **How to Bold Text in Discord?**

A simple way to use bold text style is to add two asterisks (\*\*) at the beginning and the end of the text that you want to have this effect.

#### **How to Italicize in Discord?**

Italicized style of text will be displayed in the chat if you put one asterisk character (\*) before and one more after the selected text.

#### **How to Write Strikethrough and Make Discord Cross Out Text?**

In order to get a strikethrough effect on your text, you will have to type two tilde characters (\~\~) on either side of the section of text that you want to change, and then you will create an appearance of a crossed-out portion of text.

#### **How to Make Discord Underline Text?**

Underline effect is also available on Discord and equally simple to activate. Just type two underscore dashes (\_\_)at the start and the ending of the text selection to apply it.

### How to Combine Text Formatting Options in Discord?

Once you mastered the basic effects and know the commands without thinking, it’s time to consider more complex text transformations that combine more than one effect. In principle, Markdown lets you do this just as easily, for as long as you know all the right combinations of characters that produce the desired effect. Here are the detailed instructions for some of the most frequently utilized combos:

#### Underlined and Italicized text

For this elegant combination, use two underscore dashes (\_\_) followed by one asterisk (\*) before and after the selected text.

![Discord Underlined and Italicized text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-text.jpg)

#### Underlined and Bolded text

Put two underscore dashes (\_\_) and add two asterisk characters (\*\*) to both sides of the selection to get those two effects together.

![Discord Underlined and Bolded text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-bolded-text.jpg)

#### Underlined, Italicized, and Bolded text

This combination is achieved by placing two underscore marks (\_\_) and three straight asterisks (\*\*\*) at the beginning as well as the end of the text.

![Discord Underlined &  Italicized Bolded  text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-bolded-text.jpg)

#### Bolded, Italicized, underlined, and crossed out text

You can combine all four style changes as well – just use two tildes (\~\~), two underscores (\_\_) and three asterisks (\*\*\*) on either side of your text.

![Discord Underlined &  Italicized Bolded crossed out text ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-bolded-cross-out-text.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Use Code Block for Discord Text Formatting?

In addition to simple font transformations, Discord allows users to engage in advanced text formatting with incredible ease. One way to do it is to deploy code blocks, which can be activated with the backtick character ( \` ) placed on the beginning and the end of a text section. This command will highlight the chosen part of the text while preserving blank space around it for extra emphasis of your message. However, if you use three consecutive ( \` ) signs before a block of text and separate the text into several lines by pressing enter, the result will be a series of highlighted lines that form a single code block. This option is simple enough that even beginners with no programming abilities can easily learn how to use it, and it has some practical applications that savvy Discord users are very fond of.

## Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?

It’s not possible to alter the default text color from the native user interface in Discord. However, there is a simple solution to this problem that involves the highlight.is scrip mentioned earlier in the article. This Javascript-based library can transform the normal text into a code block consisting of three lines, where the middle line would be your selection of text in an alternative color. This is a neat workaround that’s very simple to activate using the same kind of text-based commands described above.

To change the text color, you should create a simple, three-line block. In the top line, you need to put three backtick characters (”’) along with a code phrase corresponding to the text color you would like to use. In the second line, you should type your entire text normally, while the bottom line should include three more backticks. You can create new lines by pressing the Shift and Enter keys at the same time.

Here is a detailed video tutorial for creating customized text in a range of different colors with all the relevant code phrases.

## FAQs About Discord Text Formatting

#### 1\. What is the default Discord font?

Discord uses the same basic font all over the entire platform, including all chats between users and in your profile info. This is Uni sans font, which is quite simple and belongs to the sans serif family of fonts that are known for good readability on almost any background.

#### 2\. How do you get different fonts on Discord?

It’s not possible to change the font directly from the Discord app, but this limitation can be circumvented if you find a good[Discord font generator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on the internet. Those are very easy to use, so you can simply type your text in a chosen font and copy it back into Discord already formatted.

#### 3\. How to make a hidden text in Discord?

The creation of a hidden text message that requires direct user action to reveal is possible in Discord and requires a so-called spoiler tag. If you precede your message with the text /spoiler or type two slash bars ( //) at either side, it will be hidden from other users except for those who decide to view it and indicate their desire by clicking or tapping on it. Messages of this kind appear highlighted with gray background in the message stream on a Discord chat.

## Part 1: How Does Discord Text Engine Work?

Beneath the surface, Discord runs on a powerful engine called Markdown, which regulates how text is displayed on the pages visible to users. It’s an application of markup language that completely depends on textual symbols as commands, making it quite simple for users who are not skilled at advanced programming to alter the look of the text.

Basically, Markdown allows you to enter a few symbols and it will interpret them as commands for changing the text style, for example bolding or underlying certain word or sentence. For highlighting blocks of text, there is a specific library named [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) that allows simple text marking for stylistic emphasis.

This approach is very practical and easy to learn, so long-time users of Discord are able to change text style as they type without thinking too much about it. Really, it’s all about following a couple of simple rules and knowing the most important combinations of characters (tags).

## Part 2: How to Change Text Style in Discord with Markdown?

As we mentioned previously, Markdown is completely text-based and has a very simple syntax. All you need to do to apply special formatting to your text is to enter a few special characters at the right places, and the appropriate effect (bold, italic…) will appear in the chat. Keep in mind that you can easily combine the formatting styles by using multiple commands at the same time.

Here is an overview of the most important options for changing text style in Discord, and you can preview the text style in real time before sending to friends:

![Change Text Style in Discord  - Basic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-change-text-style.jpg)

#### **How to Bold Text in Discord?**

A simple way to use bold text style is to add two asterisks (\*\*) at the beginning and the end of the text that you want to have this effect.

#### **How to Italicize in Discord?**

Italicized style of text will be displayed in the chat if you put one asterisk character (\*) before and one more after the selected text.

#### **How to Write Strikethrough and Make Discord Cross Out Text?**

In order to get a strikethrough effect on your text, you will have to type two tilde characters (\~\~) on either side of the section of text that you want to change, and then you will create an appearance of a crossed-out portion of text.

#### **How to Make Discord Underline Text?**

Underline effect is also available on Discord and equally simple to activate. Just type two underscore dashes (\_\_)at the start and the ending of the text selection to apply it.

### How to Combine Text Formatting Options in Discord?

Once you mastered the basic effects and know the commands without thinking, it’s time to consider more complex text transformations that combine more than one effect. In principle, Markdown lets you do this just as easily, for as long as you know all the right combinations of characters that produce the desired effect. Here are the detailed instructions for some of the most frequently utilized combos:

#### Underlined and Italicized text

For this elegant combination, use two underscore dashes (\_\_) followed by one asterisk (\*) before and after the selected text.

![Discord Underlined and Italicized text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-text.jpg)

#### Underlined and Bolded text

Put two underscore dashes (\_\_) and add two asterisk characters (\*\*) to both sides of the selection to get those two effects together.

![Discord Underlined and Bolded text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-bolded-text.jpg)

#### Underlined, Italicized, and Bolded text

This combination is achieved by placing two underscore marks (\_\_) and three straight asterisks (\*\*\*) at the beginning as well as the end of the text.

![Discord Underlined &  Italicized Bolded  text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-bolded-text.jpg)

#### Bolded, Italicized, underlined, and crossed out text

You can combine all four style changes as well – just use two tildes (\~\~), two underscores (\_\_) and three asterisks (\*\*\*) on either side of your text.

![Discord Underlined &  Italicized Bolded crossed out text ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-bolded-cross-out-text.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Use Code Block for Discord Text Formatting?

In addition to simple font transformations, Discord allows users to engage in advanced text formatting with incredible ease. One way to do it is to deploy code blocks, which can be activated with the backtick character ( \` ) placed on the beginning and the end of a text section. This command will highlight the chosen part of the text while preserving blank space around it for extra emphasis of your message. However, if you use three consecutive ( \` ) signs before a block of text and separate the text into several lines by pressing enter, the result will be a series of highlighted lines that form a single code block. This option is simple enough that even beginners with no programming abilities can easily learn how to use it, and it has some practical applications that savvy Discord users are very fond of.

## Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?

It’s not possible to alter the default text color from the native user interface in Discord. However, there is a simple solution to this problem that involves the highlight.is scrip mentioned earlier in the article. This Javascript-based library can transform the normal text into a code block consisting of three lines, where the middle line would be your selection of text in an alternative color. This is a neat workaround that’s very simple to activate using the same kind of text-based commands described above.

To change the text color, you should create a simple, three-line block. In the top line, you need to put three backtick characters (”’) along with a code phrase corresponding to the text color you would like to use. In the second line, you should type your entire text normally, while the bottom line should include three more backticks. You can create new lines by pressing the Shift and Enter keys at the same time.

Here is a detailed video tutorial for creating customized text in a range of different colors with all the relevant code phrases.

## FAQs About Discord Text Formatting

#### 1\. What is the default Discord font?

Discord uses the same basic font all over the entire platform, including all chats between users and in your profile info. This is Uni sans font, which is quite simple and belongs to the sans serif family of fonts that are known for good readability on almost any background.

#### 2\. How do you get different fonts on Discord?

It’s not possible to change the font directly from the Discord app, but this limitation can be circumvented if you find a good[Discord font generator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on the internet. Those are very easy to use, so you can simply type your text in a chosen font and copy it back into Discord already formatted.

#### 3\. How to make a hidden text in Discord?

The creation of a hidden text message that requires direct user action to reveal is possible in Discord and requires a so-called spoiler tag. If you precede your message with the text /spoiler or type two slash bars ( //) at either side, it will be hidden from other users except for those who decide to view it and indicate their desire by clicking or tapping on it. Messages of this kind appear highlighted with gray background in the message stream on a Discord chat.
