## Part 2: How to Stream on Discord from Chromebook

Chromebooks have a customized Android operating software that can fit the laptop, functioning seamlessly with its requirements.

However, because Chromebooks use a restrictive OS, the Discord app functions like it would on a smartphone or tablet.

Therefore, for Discord streaming on a Chromebook, you will have to:

1. Select a voice channel and then join it
2. Press the Video camera icon to share your screen
3. Allow the program camera access
4. Begin streaming

However, it is slightly challenging to join voice channels using the app. To do this, you will have to:

1. Locate the voice channel and click on it
2. Upon clicking, you will see a window appear at the bottom
3. Scroll to the bottom of the menu, and click on the ‘Join Channel’ button
4. To join with the camera, click on the camcorder icon

## Part 3: How to Stream on Discord from iPhone And Android

Although Discord does not allow users to broadcast content from the Discord Mobile app, they can still share their screen to stream games and videos. To do so, they must:

1. Select a voice channel and join it
2. Press the Video camera icon for screen-sharing
3. Then allow permission to third-party apps on the mobile to access your camera
4. Press the Camera icon to allow the program access to your camera
5. Once this is done, you are now streaming live

## Part 1: How to Stream on Discord from Desktop Computers

### How to Stream on Discord from Windows

Discord allows for streaming through its Windows desktop client. You can stream games, podcasts, and any other kind of content through it.

However, it is crucial to remember that you can only stream in 480p and 720p resolutions in the free version. If you want higher resolution streaming, subscribe to Discord Nitro, which costs $9.99 a month.

With that said, follow these steps to start Discord streaming:

1. Start the game that you want to stream and then switch back to Discord
2. You will find an icon at the bottom left of the window displaying the name of the game you started and a stream icon resembling a camera next to it. Click on this icon to begin streaming
3. The Screen Share menu will pop-up displaying the game you have started, and from the ‘Select a voice channel’ drop-down, select the channel you want to stream with
4. Adjust your screen resolution and frame rates according to your choice
5. After you’ve made all the adjustments, you can hit the ‘Go Live’ button at the bottom right of the window to start streaming.

If you wish to stop streaming, click on the ‘Stop Streaming’ icon at the app's bottom-left corner

Additionally, if you wish to stream voice and video calls on your Discord server, you can do so as well. To make a call to your friends through Discord:

1. Open the Discord app on your Windows PC and then select the server you want to use
2. Click the General Voice channel to place a voice connection with Discord
3. On the bottom left of the window, you will see a Voice Connected entry. If you wish to video call, click on the ‘Video’ button; otherwise, click on the ‘Screen’ button for screen sharing

5. If you click on the screen, a pop-up window shows up, allowing you to select the application you want to share
6. After setting this up, your friends can join your call by clicking on the General channel

When you want to end the call, click on the red Disconnect icon
