## Part 1: Best Settings for Discord Video Call

Before you start calling everyone, you’ll want to check your settings to make sure you have the best experience. It’s important to make sure you’ve got your best equipment setup to work for the highest quality audio and video possible.

![Discord User Settings option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

So, start by heading to the User Settings page. You’ll find this at the bottom left of the screen – look for the cog icon next to your name. You won’t see this on mobile, this is only on the desktop app and the web browser version of Discord.

![Discord Video Call Settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-settings.jpg)

Once you’ve opened settings, you’ll want to click on the **Voice & Video** tab. Here you can check your microphone settings and adjust the volume, and choose your camera. If you’re using an external camera instead of the built-in option, check that the right one is selected in the dropdown.

You can also use this opportunity to run a test video – so that you know you’re well-lit, properly framed and otherwise good to go. You can adjust the lighting in your room or move the camera if you don’t feel it’s quite right.

One quick note for the web browser version of Discord – you’ll be asked to grant permission to your microphone and camera. Make sure you allow the site to use your equipment otherwise it won’t work on the video call.

Once you are happy, just click the close button at the top right of the settings options.

## Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?

Once you’ve got your settings ready, you’re set to make your private Discord video call. If you’re doing it on the web browser or desktop app, you’ll need to first navigate to the inbox you share with the person you want to call. Do this by clicking on the Home button at the top left – you’ll then get a list of all your contacts.

If you’re only calling one person then it’s easy – just click on their name.

![Discord Video Call with Friends ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-discord-friend.jpg)

If you want to call a private group, you need to click the + button and then create a group DM. Add the names of the users you want to call.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Discord Video Call with group ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friend-group-video-call-discord.jpg)

Once you’re in the direct message window of the person or group you want to call, you need to look at the buttons at the top right of the screen. The second icon that looks like a video camera is the one you’re looking for. Click that and you’ll start a video call.

You’ll see yourself on screen at this point, but you’ll need to wait until the other person or group members have joined the call for the chat to properly begin.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Discord Video Call interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg)

The process of making video call on Discord mobile is essentially identical. You just need to open the direct message group and click on the video call icon, which is still at the top right of your screen.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Discord Video Call interface on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discrod-personal-video-call-mobile.jpg)

You’ll need to give permissions for the Discord mobile app to use your microphone and camera if you haven’t already.

Once you’ve finished your video call on either desktop or mobile, just hit the red button to end it and switch your camera off again.

## Part 3: How to Make a Server Video Call on Discord?

If you want to make a group video call on a public server, you again need to first navigate to the server. Once you’re there, you’ll need to join the voice channel that you should see on the left side of the screen.

Once you’re in the voice channel, click Lounge, Community Hangout or Stream Room, and then switch on your camera by clicking the ‘Video’ button. You’ll find this at the bottom-left of the screen. Again, if you’re on the web browser, you’ll be asked by your browser for permission to use your camera at this stage.

<a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698" border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"/></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Discord Server Video Call  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-video-call.jpg)

And that’s it – the video call is now live and anyone who joins the voice channel will be able to see you, chat to you and switch on their camera to join the video conference as well.

On mobile, it’s slightly different. You’ll still want to head to the server you want to join and then click on the voice channel to join it. But as soon as you click on the voice channel, you’ll get a pop-up with an icon at the bottom right where you can instantly switch on your camera.

![Discord Server Video Call on mobile  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-video-call-mobile.jpg)

If you prefer, you can still just join as voice, and then at any stage click on your name where you’ll be able to then switch on your camera to turn a voice chat into a video call.

Whenever you want to end the video call, just click on your name again to switch off your camera, or disconnect completely from the voice channel.

## FAQs About Discord Video Chat Call

#### 1\. How Many People Can Join in the Discord Group Video Call?

Normally, the limit for the number of users on a group video call in Discord is 10\. However, during the Coronavirus pandemic, the team behind Discord know that it’s a valuable tool to help people stay connected. So the limit has been increased to 25 users. This may be reduced in the future once the world returns to some sense of normality.

#### 2\. How to Join a Video Call on Discord?

Joining an existing video call on Discord is a really easy process.

If it’s a private video call, you’ll get a pop-up in the chat window letting you know that a video call has been started. You have the option of declining the video call, joining it with video, or just joining with voice without your camera switched on.

If instead, it’s a public server where a video call is happening, you just need to join the voice channel by clicking on it on the left side of the screen, and then clicking on the video button next to your name, just as if you were starting the call in the first place.

If you want to make a group video call on a public server, you again need to first navigate to the server. Once you’re there, you’ll need to join the voice channel that you should see on the left side of the screen.

Once you’re in the voice channel, click Lounge, Community Hangout or Stream Room, and then switch on your camera by clicking the ‘Video’ button. You’ll find this at the bottom-left of the screen. Again, if you’re on the web browser, you’ll be asked by your browser for permission to use your camera at this stage.

![Discord Server Video Call  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-video-call.jpg)

And that’s it – the video call is now live and anyone who joins the voice channel will be able to see you, chat to you and switch on their camera to join the video conference as well.

On mobile, it’s slightly different. You’ll still want to head to the server you want to join and then click on the voice channel to join it. But as soon as you click on the voice channel, you’ll get a pop-up with an icon at the bottom right where you can instantly switch on your camera.

If you prefer, you can still just join as voice, and then at any stage click on your name where you’ll be able to then switch on your camera to turn a voice chat into a video call.

Whenever you want to end the video call, just click on your name again to switch off your camera, or disconnect completely from the voice channel.

## FAQs About Discord Video Chat Call

#### 1\. How Many People Can Join in the Discord Group Video Call?

Normally, the limit for the number of users on a group video call in Discord is 10\. However, during the Coronavirus pandemic, the team behind Discord know that it’s a valuable tool to help people stay connected. So the limit has been increased to 25 users. This may be reduced in the future once the world returns to some sense of normality.

#### 2\. How to Join a Video Call on Discord?

Joining an existing video call on Discord is a really easy process.

If it’s a private video call, you’ll get a pop-up in the chat window letting you know that a video call has been started. You have the option of declining the video call, joining it with video, or just joining with voice without your camera switched on.

If instead, it’s a public server where a video call is happening, you just need to join the voice channel by clicking on it on the left side of the screen, and then clicking on the video button next to your name, just as if you were starting the call in the first place.

Discord has video call options built into the desktop app, the web browser and the mobile app, so you don’t need to switch between different software when you want to chat on video with your friends or colleagues. Read on to find out how to make a video call on Discord.

* [Part 4: FAQs about Discord Video Call](#part4)

## Part 1: Best Settings for Discord Video Call

Before you start calling everyone, you’ll want to check your settings to make sure you have the best experience. It’s important to make sure you’ve got your best equipment setup to work for the highest quality audio and video possible.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Discord User Settings option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

So, start by heading to the User Settings page. You’ll find this at the bottom left of the screen – look for the cog icon next to your name. You won’t see this on mobile, this is only on the desktop app and the web browser version of Discord.

![Discord Video Call Settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-settings.jpg)

Once you’ve opened settings, you’ll want to click on the **Voice & Video** tab. Here you can check your microphone settings and adjust the volume, and choose your camera. If you’re using an external camera instead of the built-in option, check that the right one is selected in the dropdown.

You can also use this opportunity to run a test video – so that you know you’re well-lit, properly framed and otherwise good to go. You can adjust the lighting in your room or move the camera if you don’t feel it’s quite right.

One quick note for the web browser version of Discord – you’ll be asked to grant permission to your microphone and camera. Make sure you allow the site to use your equipment otherwise it won’t work on the video call.

Once you are happy, just click the close button at the top right of the settings options.

## Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?

Once you’ve got your settings ready, you’re set to make your private Discord video call. If you’re doing it on the web browser or desktop app, you’ll need to first navigate to the inbox you share with the person you want to call. Do this by clicking on the Home button at the top left – you’ll then get a list of all your contacts.

If you’re only calling one person then it’s easy – just click on their name.

![Discord Video Call with Friends ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-discord-friend.jpg)

If you want to call a private group, you need to click the + button and then create a group DM. Add the names of the users you want to call.

![Discord Video Call with group ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friend-group-video-call-discord.jpg)

Once you’re in the direct message window of the person or group you want to call, you need to look at the buttons at the top right of the screen. The second icon that looks like a video camera is the one you’re looking for. Click that and you’ll start a video call.

You’ll see yourself on screen at this point, but you’ll need to wait until the other person or group members have joined the call for the chat to properly begin.

![Discord Video Call interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg)

The process of making video call on Discord mobile is essentially identical. You just need to open the direct message group and click on the video call icon, which is still at the top right of your screen.

![Discord Video Call interface on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discrod-personal-video-call-mobile.jpg)

Once you’ve finished your video call on either desktop or mobile, just hit the red button to end it and switch your camera off again.

Discord is all fun and games if you are a part of a lively server that has a cool community. You can obsess about some game, comic, or song with hundreds of other people without the fear of being called geeky.

Whatever your reason, here is a detailed guide on how to leave a server on Discord!

A few things to note before you leave a server –

* You will not receive any notifications from the server.
* Your username will no longer appear in the member list of the server.
* Whatever role you had in the server will be disabled.
* If you own a server, you will have to transfer the ownership to another member before you quit.

## Bonus: How to Transfer Discord Server Ownership?

How to leave your own Discord server? If your server has many members in it, it is wiser to transfer the ownership rather than shutting the server completely or abandoning it to fate. Especially if the users are active, then you can handover the ownership to a trustworthy person.

Here is how you can do it -

**For desktop**

The process is quite simple and only takes a few minutes.

1. Open the Discord app or log in using the browser.
2. Click on the server that you want to leave.
3. With right-click, open up the floating menu.
4. From that list, select server settings and then choose members.
5. Select the user that You Want To handover your server to. Tap those 3 dots and tap on ‘transfer ownership.’
6. Confirm your choice and then click on transfer ownership.
7. The chosen member will become the new owner of the server.

**On mobile**

The transfer procedure is quite similar to the desktop version. However, it has a few extra steps.

1. Open your Discord App on your phone.
2. Select the server that you want to give away.
3. Tap those 3 dots to open up the menu. Under user management, tap on ‘members.'
4. Select the member that will be the new owner of your server. Tap the 3 dots that appear next to the name of that user.
5. A confirmation box will appear.
6. Check off the box to confirm your choice.

Your server is now successfully transferred to the selected member. And the new owner can decide what to do with the server.

FAQs About Leaving A Discord Server

1. How can I leave a Discord server without anyone knowing?

Frankly speaking, there is no magic to help conceal your disappearance from a server. There is no way to hide your departure. However, you can take a few measures to make it less noticeable.

* Lay low for a few hours or days. This won’t work if you are the loudest member on the server. But still, it’s worth a shot.
* Try changing your avatar, profile picture, and nickname. This can throw people off the track or confuse them for a while.
* Control yourself and try not to tell anyone that you are leaving.
* And now it’s time for the discreet farewell!

You might still get some texts on personal asking about your exit. This is not a surefire way of making your exit a secret. However, hundreds of members along with bots will make your disappearance less apparent. Another solution would be to create a new user ID and leave the old one inactive.

1. Does leaving a Discord server delete your messages?

No, none of the texts that you sent on the server get deleted. Every text remains, even after you leave. The only way you can delete your texts if you delete them all one by one, or someone with sufficient permissions deletes them. If you get banned, then the member who banned you decides whether to keep your messages on the server or remove them. In this case, your texts can be removed if the member deletes them.

This was a guide on ‘**how to leave a Discord server’** that provided a detailed how-to on leaving servers and transferring servers.

After confirming you won't be a part of that server anymore. You cannot send any texts or get any notifications. The server name will disappear from the server list in your profile.

## Part 2: How to Leave a Discord Server on the Mobile App?

The procedure of leaving the server is more or less the same on the mobile app. The user interface of Discord does not differ much across the devices. To quit a server, follow these steps -

1. Click open the Discord app on your mobile.
2. Click on the right pane and click on the 3 dots that appear. Click on the name of the server that you want to leave.

After confirmation, you will not be a part of the server anymore. The process is the same for ios and Android devices.

If you have decided to take a break from gaming and Discord, you can consider uninstalling the app temporarily. You can also turn off the notifications in the app settings on your device.

## Bonus: How to Transfer Discord Server Ownership?

How to leave your own Discord server? If your server has many members in it, it is wiser to transfer the ownership rather than shutting the server completely or abandoning it to fate. Especially if the users are active, then you can handover the ownership to a trustworthy person.

Here is how you can do it -

**For desktop**

The process is quite simple and only takes a few minutes.

1. Open the Discord app or log in using the browser.
2. Click on the server that you want to leave.
3. With right-click, open up the floating menu.
4. From that list, select server settings and then choose members.
5. Select the user that You Want To handover your server to. Tap those 3 dots and tap on ‘transfer ownership.’
6. Confirm your choice and then click on transfer ownership.
7. The chosen member will become the new owner of the server.

**On mobile**

The transfer procedure is quite similar to the desktop version. However, it has a few extra steps.

1. Open your Discord App on your phone.
2. Select the server that you want to give away.
3. Tap those 3 dots to open up the menu. Under user management, tap on ‘members.'
4. Select the member that will be the new owner of your server. Tap the 3 dots that appear next to the name of that user.
5. A confirmation box will appear.
6. Check off the box to confirm your choice.

Your server is now successfully transferred to the selected member. And the new owner can decide what to do with the server.

FAQs About Leaving A Discord Server

1. How can I leave a Discord server without anyone knowing?

Frankly speaking, there is no magic to help conceal your disappearance from a server. There is no way to hide your departure. However, you can take a few measures to make it less noticeable.

* Lay low for a few hours or days. This won’t work if you are the loudest member on the server. But still, it’s worth a shot.
* Try changing your avatar, profile picture, and nickname. This can throw people off the track or confuse them for a while.
* Control yourself and try not to tell anyone that you are leaving.
* And now it’s time for the discreet farewell!

You might still get some texts on personal asking about your exit. This is not a surefire way of making your exit a secret. However, hundreds of members along with bots will make your disappearance less apparent. Another solution would be to create a new user ID and leave the old one inactive.

1. Does leaving a Discord server delete your messages?

No, none of the texts that you sent on the server get deleted. Every text remains, even after you leave. The only way you can delete your texts if you delete them all one by one, or someone with sufficient permissions deletes them. If you get banned, then the member who banned you decides whether to keep your messages on the server or remove them. In this case, your texts can be removed if the member deletes them.

This was a guide on ‘**how to leave a Discord server’** that provided a detailed how-to on leaving servers and transferring servers.
