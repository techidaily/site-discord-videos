# How To Delete Messages On Discord \[2024 Updated\]

Discord allows users to hold onto their message history forever, storing billions of messages in a blog post. And unlike other apps, Discord does not allow users to mass-delete their message history. For some, that can sound like a nightmare because of privacy and security reasons. You will have to wade through every message, deleting each of them, one by one.

However, if you find yourself in that position, fret not because there are several solutions to help you get around this limitation. Unfortunately, none of them are perfect.

Since there is no official method of mass deleting messages, these workarounds are shoddy, but until Discord offers an official solution, we'll have to do with them.

If you're looking to mass-delete your messages from a server or channel on Discord, here's how you will go about it for the desktop and mobile versions:

* [**Part 2: How to Delete Direct Messages on Discord**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: Deleting Channel Messages in Discord**](#part3)
* [**Part 4: Deleting Messages with Discord Clear Chat Bot**](#part4)
* [**Part 5: Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord**](#part5)

## Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types

In Discord, you will see two types of messages: Direct Messages and Channel Messages in servers. Here are the differences between the two:

* **Direct Messages**: These messages are private and held between two users
* **Channel Messages**: These messages are sent in a channel or a specific group

Both of these message types abide by different rules and functions. In the early days of Discord, users had the luxury of deleting messages in bulk.

However, this was soon changed because the mass execution directly affected the app's database. Since then, the application has adopted specific rules regarding message deletion.

## Part 2: How to Delete Direct Messages on Discord

If you use Discord on your desktop computer, this section will discuss the steps to follow to delete your direct messages.

However, keep in mind that Discord does not allow you to delete direct messages. If you don't want to show messages from a particular friend, you can remove the chat copy, and it will disappear from the messages temporarily, although it will still be visible in the recipient's chats. And if the friend contacts you again, the messages will show.

![Remove Discord Direct Message Copy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-discord-copy.jpg)

You can delete the local copy of messages by following the steps below:

1. Open the Discord program on your computer and go to the chat panel of the person whom you direct messaged;
2. Tap on the 'Message' option on the left side, and then select the 'Direct Message' option on the top left side;
3. Select the message that you want to delete and click the 3 dots to click on Delete Message, then the message you sent will be deleted at your end.

![ delete Discord Message  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-discord-direct-message.jpg)

The procedure for deleting DMs from your Discord smartphone application applies for both the Android and IOS application, and it is as follows:

1. Open the Discord app on your smartphone
2. Find the message that you want to delete
3. Tap and hold the message. You will be presented with a list
4. Tap 'Delete' on that list
5. Confirm your decision by tapping 'Delete' once again
6. The message will be deleted

## Part 3: How to Delete Channel Messages in Discord?

This method has to be the most effective and easy way to delete a Discord message, and it's a simple, straightforward procedure:

1. Go to the message and glide over it to reveal the three-tier settings icon
2. Click on it to show options, and then select Delete Message

To do this individually, you will need to use the mouse consistently, eating up a lot of time. If you wish to do it by keyboard, you can do so, provided you know the sequence for the keyboard commands for deletion.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the sequence:

1. Select the Chat panel that you want to delete
2. Hover your cursor over the messages you wish to delete
3. A three-dot icon will appear on the right side of the message
4. Click on the icon, and a pop-menu will show
5. On the pop-up menu, select 'Delete'
6. You will be prompted with a confirmation for deleting the message
7. Tick the confirmation and tap the 'Delete' button
8. Your message will be deleted

At first glance, it seems like a long and tedious process, but once you get down to doing it and develop a rhythm, it is an easy task.

## Part 4: Deleting Message with Discord Clear Chat Bot

Please keep in mind that Discord has changed its policy regarding bots, going from discouraging their use to outright flagging them as a violation of its terms.

Using bots can put you at risk of termination from the app, so we would not advise you to adopt this method, and if you do, please tread with caution.

With that said, many users report that using self-bots does not significantly lead to any disciplinary action from Discord, given that the reason for use is not harmful or disruptive.

Discord requires that all bots are tracked through its 'Develop Portal.' Self-bots run on a Discord API token and can circumvent this rule, allowing them access to API requests hence automating many tasks, such as deleting messages.

The Discord API supports a POST request, letting bots swiftly discard messages less than fourteen days old. Messages that are older than this timeframe can be queued and discarded one-by-one.

One particular bot that is of interest to us is the MEE6\. It is used to control moderation, set-up leveling, manage music, and much more, including mass-deleting messages on Discord.

We've outlined a few commands you can use to delete your chats. These are as follows:

1. Go to the official MEE6 website and click on the button that says Add to Discord

![delete messages on discord with mee6 bot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-bot-mee6.jpg)

1. You'll be prompted to authorize so that MEE6 bot can access your username, and know what server you’re in.
2. Pin-point the server you want to add the bot and then set up to connect MEE6 to the Discord server.

![how to delete discord message with mee6 bot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-server-to-add-mee6-bot-discord.jpg)

1. Click Authorize again and the bot will be added to your Discord server soon;
2. To enable MEE6 to clear the chat, you should enable the Moderator plugin first. Click the Moderator option under Plugins first, and then click Yes.

![remove discord message with mee 6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mee6-moderator-plugin-moderator.jpg)

1. Now go to the server in your Discord and type in “!clear @username” to remove every message sent by the user you've mentioned.

![delete discord channel message with MEE6 Bot  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-channel-message-in-bulk-mee6-discord.jpg)

To clear the last 100 messages on your server, type in “!clear 100”. You can replace 100 with any number of your choice. However, MEE6 can’t delete messages past 2 weeks.

## Part 5: How to Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord?

In the section above, we talked about deleting messages without using the mouse. That leads us to the possibility of utilizing the 'AutoHotkey' script to automate the process.

Most developers have come up with codes that can delete Discord messages from your account on a mass scale. We'll be expanding on one of the most popular instances of this: the AutoHotkey script.

Before you get started with this, you will need an 'AutoHotkey installer.' Continue the process by:

1. Download and install the 'AutoHotkey installer' ;
2. Head onto your desktop, right-click and click 'New' on the drop-down menu;
3. Choose the 'AutoHotkey script' and right-click on this file and edit with 'Notepad'
4. Delete everything in the script and paste the following code

**_t::_**

**_Loop, 100000_**

**_{_**

**_send, {Up}_**

**_send, ^a_**

**_send, {BS}_**

**_send, {Enter}_**

**_send, {Enter}_**

**_sleep, 100_**

**_}_**

**_Return_**

1. Save the file as any name that you wish to
2. Once you've done that, launch Discord and double-click on the script file
3. Open the chat data that you wish to delete and press T
4. The script will now delete all the messages

To stop the script, click on the H icon located on the right side of your taskbar and select Pause Script.

This is the process by which you can use an 'Autohotkey script' to delete messages in bulk. Please note that this option is only available to Windows users as AutoHotkey does not currently work on macOS.

Ideally, you'll want the following things from your AutoHotkey script:

1. A toggle key for turning it on and off
2. The complete keyboard sequence with stops between each step

**Disclaimer**: you can delete a message you sent, but there's no saying if the other person took a screenshot before you got around to deleting it. Things on the internet tend to stick around. So, as a safe bet, it's a good idea to take some time to consider what you wrote before pressing send to avoid any regrets.

## FAQs About Deleting Discord Messages

#### 1\. Can I Recover A Deleted Message on Discord?

Unfortunately, once a message is deleted, there is no way for Discord users to reaccess it.

#### 2\. Can I View Deleted Messages?

Unfortunately, there is no way to see deleted messages. Channel and server admins can see if a message was deleted, but they cannot see the deleted message's contents.

#### 3\. How Can I Delete Other People's Messages?

If you are an admin or an owner of a server, you can delete other people's messages by following one of the methods mentioned above.

We've outlined a few commands you can use to delete your chats. These are as follows:

1. Go to the official MEE6 website and click on the button that says Add to Discord

![delete messages on discord with mee6 bot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-bot-mee6.jpg)

1. You'll be prompted to authorize so that MEE6 bot can access your username, and know what server you’re in.
2. Pin-point the server you want to add the bot and then set up to connect MEE6 to the Discord server.

![how to delete discord message with mee6 bot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-server-to-add-mee6-bot-discord.jpg)

1. Click Authorize again and the bot will be added to your Discord server soon;
2. To enable MEE6 to clear the chat, you should enable the Moderator plugin first. Click the Moderator option under Plugins first, and then click Yes.

![remove discord message with mee 6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mee6-moderator-plugin-moderator.jpg)

1. Now go to the server in your Discord and type in “!clear @username” to remove every message sent by the user you've mentioned.

![delete discord channel message with MEE6 Bot  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-channel-message-in-bulk-mee6-discord.jpg)

To clear the last 100 messages on your server, type in “!clear 100”. You can replace 100 with any number of your choice. However, MEE6 can’t delete messages past 2 weeks.

## Part 5: How to Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord?

In the section above, we talked about deleting messages without using the mouse. That leads us to the possibility of utilizing the 'AutoHotkey' script to automate the process.

Most developers have come up with codes that can delete Discord messages from your account on a mass scale. We'll be expanding on one of the most popular instances of this: the AutoHotkey script.

Before you get started with this, you will need an 'AutoHotkey installer.' Continue the process by:

1. Download and install the 'AutoHotkey installer' ;
2. Head onto your desktop, right-click and click 'New' on the drop-down menu;
3. Choose the 'AutoHotkey script' and right-click on this file and edit with 'Notepad'
4. Delete everything in the script and paste the following code

**_t::_**

**_Loop, 100000_**

**_{_**

**_send, {Up}_**

**_send, ^a_**

**_send, {BS}_**

**_send, {Enter}_**

**_send, {Enter}_**

**_sleep, 100_**

**_}_**

**_Return_**

1. Save the file as any name that you wish to
2. Once you've done that, launch Discord and double-click on the script file
3. Open the chat data that you wish to delete and press T
4. The script will now delete all the messages

To stop the script, click on the H icon located on the right side of your taskbar and select Pause Script.

This is the process by which you can use an 'Autohotkey script' to delete messages in bulk. Please note that this option is only available to Windows users as AutoHotkey does not currently work on macOS.

Ideally, you'll want the following things from your AutoHotkey script:

1. A toggle key for turning it on and off
2. The complete keyboard sequence with stops between each step

**Disclaimer**: you can delete a message you sent, but there's no saying if the other person took a screenshot before you got around to deleting it. Things on the internet tend to stick around. So, as a safe bet, it's a good idea to take some time to consider what you wrote before pressing send to avoid any regrets.

Discord allows users to hold onto their message history forever, storing billions of messages in a blog post. And unlike other apps, Discord does not allow users to mass-delete their message history. For some, that can sound like a nightmare because of privacy and security reasons. You will have to wade through every message, deleting each of them, one by one.

However, if you find yourself in that position, fret not because there are several solutions to help you get around this limitation. Unfortunately, none of them are perfect.

Since there is no official method of mass deleting messages, these workarounds are shoddy, but until Discord offers an official solution, we'll have to do with them.

If you're looking to mass-delete your messages from a server or channel on Discord, here's how you will go about it for the desktop and mobile versions:

* [**Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: How to Delete Direct Messages on Discord**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: Deleting Channel Messages in Discord**](#part3)
* [**Part 4: Deleting Messages with Discord Clear Chat Bot**](#part4)
* [**Part 5: Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord**](#part5)

---

## Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types

In Discord, you will see two types of messages: Direct Messages and Channel Messages in servers. Here are the differences between the two:

* **Direct Messages**: These messages are private and held between two users
* **Channel Messages**: These messages are sent in a channel or a specific group

Both of these message types abide by different rules and functions. In the early days of Discord, users had the luxury of deleting messages in bulk.

However, this was soon changed because the mass execution directly affected the app's database. Since then, the application has adopted specific rules regarding message deletion.

## Part 2: How to Delete Direct Messages on Discord

If you use Discord on your desktop computer, this section will discuss the steps to follow to delete your direct messages.

However, keep in mind that Discord does not allow you to delete direct messages. If you don't want to show messages from a particular friend, you can remove the chat copy, and it will disappear from the messages temporarily, although it will still be visible in the recipient's chats. And if the friend contacts you again, the messages will show.

![Remove Discord Direct Message Copy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-discord-copy.jpg)

You can delete the local copy of messages by following the steps below:

1. Open the Discord program on your computer and go to the chat panel of the person whom you direct messaged;
2. Tap on the 'Message' option on the left side, and then select the 'Direct Message' option on the top left side;
3. Select the message that you want to delete and click the 3 dots to click on Delete Message, then the message you sent will be deleted at your end.

![ delete Discord Message  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-discord-direct-message.jpg)

The procedure for deleting DMs from your Discord smartphone application applies for both the Android and IOS application, and it is as follows:

1. Open the Discord app on your smartphone
2. Find the message that you want to delete
3. Tap and hold the message. You will be presented with a list
4. Tap 'Delete' on that list
5. Confirm your decision by tapping 'Delete' once again
6. The message will be deleted

## Part 3: How to Delete Channel Messages in Discord?

This method has to be the most effective and easy way to delete a Discord message, and it's a simple, straightforward procedure:

1. Go to the message and glide over it to reveal the three-tier settings icon
2. Click on it to show options, and then select Delete Message

To do this individually, you will need to use the mouse consistently, eating up a lot of time. If you wish to do it by keyboard, you can do so, provided you know the sequence for the keyboard commands for deletion.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the sequence:

1. Select the Chat panel that you want to delete
2. Hover your cursor over the messages you wish to delete
3. A three-dot icon will appear on the right side of the message
4. Click on the icon, and a pop-menu will show
5. On the pop-up menu, select 'Delete'
6. You will be prompted with a confirmation for deleting the message
7. Tick the confirmation and tap the 'Delete' button
8. Your message will be deleted

At first glance, it seems like a long and tedious process, but once you get down to doing it and develop a rhythm, it is an easy task.

## Part 4: Deleting Message with Discord Clear Chat Bot

Please keep in mind that Discord has changed its policy regarding bots, going from discouraging their use to outright flagging them as a violation of its terms.

Using bots can put you at risk of termination from the app, so we would not advise you to adopt this method, and if you do, please tread with caution.

With that said, many users report that using self-bots does not significantly lead to any disciplinary action from Discord, given that the reason for use is not harmful or disruptive.

Discord requires that all bots are tracked through its 'Develop Portal.' Self-bots run on a Discord API token and can circumvent this rule, allowing them access to API requests hence automating many tasks, such as deleting messages.

The Discord API supports a POST request, letting bots swiftly discard messages less than fourteen days old. Messages that are older than this timeframe can be queued and discarded one-by-one.

One particular bot that is of interest to us is the MEE6\. It is used to control moderation, set-up leveling, manage music, and much more, including mass-deleting messages on Discord.

We've outlined a few commands you can use to delete your chats. These are as follows:

1. Go to the official MEE6 website and click on the button that says Add to Discord

![delete messages on discord with mee6 bot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-bot-mee6.jpg)

1. You'll be prompted to authorize so that MEE6 bot can access your username, and know what server you’re in.
2. Pin-point the server you want to add the bot and then set up to connect MEE6 to the Discord server.

![how to delete discord message with mee6 bot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-server-to-add-mee6-bot-discord.jpg)

1. Click Authorize again and the bot will be added to your Discord server soon;
2. To enable MEE6 to clear the chat, you should enable the Moderator plugin first. Click the Moderator option under Plugins first, and then click Yes.

![remove discord message with mee 6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mee6-moderator-plugin-moderator.jpg)

1. Now go to the server in your Discord and type in “!clear @username” to remove every message sent by the user you've mentioned.

![delete discord channel message with MEE6 Bot  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-channel-message-in-bulk-mee6-discord.jpg)

To clear the last 100 messages on your server, type in “!clear 100”. You can replace 100 with any number of your choice. However, MEE6 can’t delete messages past 2 weeks.

## Online Platform Analysis: Which Suits You Best? Discord/Skype

# Discord Vs. Skype: Which One is Better For You?

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

What would be a catchy but concise way to describe Discord? A modern voice and text communication app that's free.

It's also wildly popular with gamers, secure with DDoS protection, and compatible with desktops as well as mobiles.

And what if you had to describe Skype in a similar manner? An all-in-one app for voice calls, messaging, video conferencing, and file transfer that allows you to connect with others no matter where you are.

Employees need to rely on VoIP apps like Skype and Discord to maintain communication with their colleagues and clients.

You might be wondering which is the better option among the two? Is Skype better than Discord, given that it's more popular and been around for longer?

Or is Discord more secure than Skype? Both these apps have different backgrounds and target different audiences. While Discord is more popular with gamers, Skype is readily used in offices.

Yet, at the same time, both offer similar sets of features that most users require from VoIP apps. So, let's get into discussing which VoIP app is better: Skype or Discord?

## Which Platform Is Better: Discord or Skype?

Our criteria will consider some aspects that are important when discussing communication platforms.

These include Privacy, Security, Sound Quality, Group Calls, Screen Sharing, Call Recording, File Sharing, The Interface, Supported platforms.

### 1. Privacy

Both Skype and Discord can be classified as VoIP apps because of their similar functionalities. However, there are also many differences in their features and who they cater to.

But when considering privacy, both apps seemed to be lacking.

Unfortunately, there have been reports of data breaches from both apps, with users complaining of having their locations and personal data compromised and leaked.

Neither of these apps promises complete privacy, and our recommendation would be to use them in combination with a reliable VPN service.

### 2. Security

Discord offers its users both DDoS and IP address protection, offering full client-to-server security.

On the other hand, Skype was rated poorly for its security but has recently upgraded its measures, hiding user's IP addresses.

### 3. Sound Quality

Discord differs from Skype in its audio-transmission methods and data usage. Skype works much like a phone connection, transmitting audio data continuously, like a phone call. In contrast, Discord only sends audio data when a user speaks during a call.

Both apps differ in their recommended bandwidth, with Skype having an extensive bandwidth of 100 kbps for voice calls and Discord with only 64 kbps in comparison.

For this reason, we would rank Skype higher than Discord for sound quality and audio transmission.

### 4. Group Calls

When comparing the two for group calls, Skype trumps Discord as the better and more widely popular option.

With Skype, users can make group audio and video calls, with as many as 25 people at the same time. On the other hand, Discord limits the number of users who can join a group call to just 10.

Also, Skype allows users to make calls on other phone numbers, including landlines, while Discord only limits calls to other Discord users.

Overall, Skype comes through as a much better choice for group calling.

### 5. Screen Sharing

In this age of remote working, the need for screen-sharing has increased drastically to enhance professional collaboration.

In this regard, both Discord and Skype offer a decent screen-sharing experience.

With Skype, users can [share their screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) even during audio calls, and it is relatively easy to do so, requiring only a single click to start screen-sharing. Plus, it allows users to take a simple screenshot as well.

In comparison, [Discord offers screen-sharing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) options that are more customizable and thorough, with more features for users to benefit from, such as fragmented sharing for people who don't want to share their full screen.

When comparing the two, Discord offers more customization, while Skype offers simple features but is more dependable and convenient. Therefore, Discord edges Skype out by a slight margin for its customizable features.

### 6. Call Recording

Skype has a definitive advantage over Discord in this department, as there is no in-built audio or video recording feature or option in Discord.

Users cannot record calls on Discord, while [Skype does grant a call recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) option for both video and audio calls.

It must be noted that the call recording feature in Skype is a recent addition, after frequent customer complaints about the lack of any call recording option.

It is also relatively simple to do so on Skype; click on the "+" icon and tap on "Start Recording." This procedure works for both the desktop and mobile versions of Skype.

However, Discord users do not need to despair, as there is a way out for their call recording woes:

They can record calls by [installing third-party apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/); however, there have been controversies regarding data breaches through third-party apps, so we'd advise treading with caution.

### 7. File Sharing

Both Discord and Skype allow their users to share multiple files with unlimited users; however, they seem to differ in the file volume that can be shared.

For Skype users, this limit is restricted to files up to 300MB. If the file volume exceeds this limit, the users will be redirected to OneDrive to share with as many users as they want.

Compared to Skype, Discord's file volume limit varies, depending on free users and Nitro users. The file limit for free users is a rather mediocre 8MB, while Nitro users have an ample limit of 50MB.

The monthly subscription for Nitro costs $4.99, so if you're looking for free options, Skype takes the win here.

When considered objectively, the Discord free version is somewhat limiting, and users will need to move onto Discord Nitro if they wish to post pictures or videos.

However, Discord does offer its users external cloud storage platforms. These storage platforms require bots to create shortcuts when exceeding the sharing limit and can be rather tedious. Overall, Skype seems to take the lead in file sharing.

### 8. The Interface

Both Skype and Discord have different interfaces, with Skype following a minimalistic layout and interface from its inception.

Since then, it has incorporated new updates and additions to account for new features that boost the user experience.

![Skype Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-interface.jpg)

Skype has traditionally been considered a business tool, ideal for making landline and international calls, with perfect compatibility with most business apps.

On the other hand, Discord is not as easy to use as Skype because of its more complex layout.

Discord, unlike Skype, is much more than a VoIP app. The gaming community relies on it to stream gaming sessions; online fan clubs also use it to share content among their communities.

Instead of just an app used to make calls, Discords presents itself as a forum for peers to hang out online.

![Discord Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

Additionally, due to its tilt towards the gaming community, Discord includes a unique feature, where each time a user makes a call, they are assigned a server. Other users can join this server without the original users having to leave their game.

This way, gamers can display their gaming skills to others in real-time. These calls are called drop-in calls and require no invites, meaning you can chat with anyone without them being your friend inside a server.

Due to its enhanced useability, Discord wins this category!

### 9. Supported Platforms

In this regard, Discord wins over Skype with a considerable lead. Discord allows users to sync with Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Steam, and many other apps, making it easy to find friends and families and connect with them.

It even allows you to check what music your friends are listening to on Spotify!

In contrast, Skype is considerably limited as it only syncs with Facebook. However, its value lies in its compatibility with business apps, notably Docs, Excel, and Powerpoint, as well as polls and whiteboard.

Recently, you will find Skype Business to be included in the Office 365 Suite, costing $8.99 as a whole.

## Skype Vs. Discord: Which One Should You Choose?

These apps deliver much of the essential features that users expect from top VoIP apps, yet they cater to different sets of users.

While Skype allows you to make mobile and landline calls by buying credit online, Discord limits itself to only app-to-app communications.

Skype also offers bots that can be found using the search option. These bots include games and music bots, but compared to Discord, they're somewhat limited.

Discord's bots keep in spirit with its gaming audience and include a diverse range of features, including some that allow you to play games, play music or create memes.

In contrast, Skype is considerably business-oriented, allowing you to host large meetings with 250 participants.

All in all, both of these apps offer unique features for their intended audiences. How useful you find each app depends on the category you belong to.

If you're a gamer who likes to connect with other gamers or stream videos, Discord is the choice for you. However, if you are a business professional looking to host video conferences, Skype is the better option.

In case that you want to record the desktop screen and the audio simultaneously, you should try Wondershare Filmora, which provides both the recording and editing tools.

Both Discord and Skype allow their users to share multiple files with unlimited users; however, they seem to differ in the file volume that can be shared.

For Skype users, this limit is restricted to files up to 300MB. If the file volume exceeds this limit, the users will be redirected to OneDrive to share with as many users as they want.

Compared to Skype, Discord's file volume limit varies, depending on free users and Nitro users. The file limit for free users is a rather mediocre 8MB, while Nitro users have an ample limit of 50MB.

The monthly subscription for Nitro costs $4.99, so if you're looking for free options, Skype takes the win here.

When considered objectively, the Discord free version is somewhat limiting, and users will need to move onto Discord Nitro if they wish to post pictures or videos.

However, Discord does offer its users external cloud storage platforms. These storage platforms require bots to create shortcuts when exceeding the sharing limit and can be rather tedious. Overall, Skype seems to take the lead in file sharing.

### 8. The Interface

Both Skype and Discord have different interfaces, with Skype following a minimalistic layout and interface from its inception.

Since then, it has incorporated new updates and additions to account for new features that boost the user experience.

Skype has traditionally been considered a business tool, ideal for making landline and international calls, with perfect compatibility with most business apps.

On the other hand, Discord is not as easy to use as Skype because of its more complex layout.

Discord, unlike Skype, is much more than a VoIP app. The gaming community relies on it to stream gaming sessions; online fan clubs also use it to share content among their communities.

Instead of just an app used to make calls, Discords presents itself as a forum for peers to hang out online.

![Discord Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

Additionally, due to its tilt towards the gaming community, Discord includes a unique feature, where each time a user makes a call, they are assigned a server. Other users can join this server without the original users having to leave their game.

This way, gamers can display their gaming skills to others in real-time. These calls are called drop-in calls and require no invites, meaning you can chat with anyone without them being your friend inside a server.

Due to its enhanced useability, Discord wins this category!

### 9. Supported Platforms

In this regard, Discord wins over Skype with a considerable lead. Discord allows users to sync with Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Steam, and many other apps, making it easy to find friends and families and connect with them.

It even allows you to check what music your friends are listening to on Spotify!

In contrast, Skype is considerably limited as it only syncs with Facebook. However, its value lies in its compatibility with business apps, notably Docs, Excel, and Powerpoint, as well as polls and whiteboard.

Recently, you will find Skype Business to be included in the Office 365 Suite, costing $8.99 as a whole.

## Skype Vs. Discord: Which One Should You Choose?

These apps deliver much of the essential features that users expect from top VoIP apps, yet they cater to different sets of users.

While Skype allows you to make mobile and landline calls by buying credit online, Discord limits itself to only app-to-app communications.

Skype also offers bots that can be found using the search option. These bots include games and music bots, but compared to Discord, they're somewhat limited.

Discord's bots keep in spirit with its gaming audience and include a diverse range of features, including some that allow you to play games, play music or create memes.

In contrast, Skype is considerably business-oriented, allowing you to host large meetings with 250 participants.

All in all, both of these apps offer unique features for their intended audiences. How useful you find each app depends on the category you belong to.

If you're a gamer who likes to connect with other gamers or stream videos, Discord is the choice for you. However, if you are a business professional looking to host video conferences, Skype is the better option.

In case that you want to record the desktop screen and the audio simultaneously, you should try Wondershare Filmora, which provides both the recording and editing tools.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

What would be a catchy but concise way to describe Discord? A modern voice and text communication app that's free.

It's also wildly popular with gamers, secure with DDoS protection, and compatible with desktops as well as mobiles.

And what if you had to describe Skype in a similar manner? An all-in-one app for voice calls, messaging, video conferencing, and file transfer that allows you to connect with others no matter where you are.

Employees need to rely on VoIP apps like Skype and Discord to maintain communication with their colleagues and clients.

You might be wondering which is the better option among the two? Is Skype better than Discord, given that it's more popular and been around for longer?

Or is Discord more secure than Skype? Both these apps have different backgrounds and target different audiences. While Discord is more popular with gamers, Skype is readily used in offices.

Yet, at the same time, both offer similar sets of features that most users require from VoIP apps. So, let's get into discussing which VoIP app is better: Skype or Discord?

## Which Platform Is Better: Discord or Skype?

Our criteria will consider some aspects that are important when discussing communication platforms.

These include Privacy, Security, Sound Quality, Group Calls, Screen Sharing, Call Recording, File Sharing, The Interface, Supported platforms.

### 1. Privacy

Both Skype and Discord can be classified as VoIP apps because of their similar functionalities. However, there are also many differences in their features and who they cater to.

But when considering privacy, both apps seemed to be lacking.

Unfortunately, there have been reports of data breaches from both apps, with users complaining of having their locations and personal data compromised and leaked.

Neither of these apps promises complete privacy, and our recommendation would be to use them in combination with a reliable VPN service.

### 2. Security

Discord offers its users both DDoS and IP address protection, offering full client-to-server security.

On the other hand, Skype was rated poorly for its security but has recently upgraded its measures, hiding user's IP addresses.

### 3. Sound Quality

Discord differs from Skype in its audio-transmission methods and data usage. Skype works much like a phone connection, transmitting audio data continuously, like a phone call. In contrast, Discord only sends audio data when a user speaks during a call.

Both apps differ in their recommended bandwidth, with Skype having an extensive bandwidth of 100 kbps for voice calls and Discord with only 64 kbps in comparison.

For this reason, we would rank Skype higher than Discord for sound quality and audio transmission.

### 4. Group Calls

When comparing the two for group calls, Skype trumps Discord as the better and more widely popular option.

With Skype, users can make group audio and video calls, with as many as 25 people at the same time. On the other hand, Discord limits the number of users who can join a group call to just 10.

Also, Skype allows users to make calls on other phone numbers, including landlines, while Discord only limits calls to other Discord users.

Overall, Skype comes through as a much better choice for group calling.

### 5. Screen Sharing

In this age of remote working, the need for screen-sharing has increased drastically to enhance professional collaboration.

In this regard, both Discord and Skype offer a decent screen-sharing experience.

With Skype, users can [share their screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) even during audio calls, and it is relatively easy to do so, requiring only a single click to start screen-sharing. Plus, it allows users to take a simple screenshot as well.

In comparison, [Discord offers screen-sharing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) options that are more customizable and thorough, with more features for users to benefit from, such as fragmented sharing for people who don't want to share their full screen.

When comparing the two, Discord offers more customization, while Skype offers simple features but is more dependable and convenient. Therefore, Discord edges Skype out by a slight margin for its customizable features.

### 6. Call Recording

Skype has a definitive advantage over Discord in this department, as there is no in-built audio or video recording feature or option in Discord.

Users cannot record calls on Discord, while [Skype does grant a call recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) option for both video and audio calls.

It must be noted that the call recording feature in Skype is a recent addition, after frequent customer complaints about the lack of any call recording option.

It is also relatively simple to do so on Skype; click on the "+" icon and tap on "Start Recording." This procedure works for both the desktop and mobile versions of Skype.

However, Discord users do not need to despair, as there is a way out for their call recording woes:

They can record calls by [installing third-party apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/); however, there have been controversies regarding data breaches through third-party apps, so we'd advise treading with caution.

### 7. File Sharing
