Try and animate every sign, icon, and letter, that are the intrinsic part of a whole logo. Also have clarity on which animation style you want. It can be natural or wild, simple or modern anything of your choice. Avoid mixing multiple themes which might create a sense of confusion to the audience.

Remember your competitors will also be thinking of animated logos, so how will you grab the attention of users is very important. Remember less is more!
