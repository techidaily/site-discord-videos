Discord servers are made and designed to help gamers – and now work colleagues – communicate and coordinate via private rooms.

As a communication app, it offers permanent servers for people who are working on the same project, playing the same game, or even if they're part of the same family!

However, you may have to someday delete a server you own.

Today we will discuss **how to delete Discord server** or deleting the Discord server of someone who has passed away:

## Part 1: How to Delete Discord Server Permanently on A Desktop?

If you are looking into **how to delete your Discord server**, you came to the right place. Even though Discord makes communication easier, you may need a break from around-the-clock connectivity for various reasons.

Discord works on desktop platforms and smartphones, with a blend of a VoIP chat system, a chat lobby, and a message board in a single app. Therefore, you can attempt to delete a server off on any device that you may have Discord downloaded and active on.

Most server owners choose to delete their Discord server when too many extra, strange, or ill-meaning visitors are visiting.

Servers are more like chat rooms inside the application. Deleting them is a relatively simple process – as you will learn from our **how to delete server on Discord** tips – however, their retrieval is impossible.

Once the server has been removed, you can not "undo the process" or recreate it. Therefore, be absolutely sure and proceed with caution.

It is also advised to skim through any essential files that you might have on the server. Back them up before letting it go forever.

And lastly, ensure that this is what you intend on doing because deleting a Discord server is permanent. Here are the simple steps to follow on **how to delete a server on Discord**:

1. Open the Discord desktop app and click on the server you want to delete
2. Once you select the server, there will be an options list under the server's name
3. Click the "server setting" button from the menu (This will be the second option on the list)
