Discord’s a great tool for getting together with people who share your interests and sharing content, ideas and discussions. The only thing is, most people have quite a few interests, and so your server is likely to be fighting for attention amongst many other servers. Users can join up to 100, after all. So, a good **Discord server logo** is essential, as it makes it easier for your server to stand out and be found. This article will look at the best free Discord server logo makers.

* [Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker](#part1)
* [Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites](#part2)
* [Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel Tips](#part3)
* [Part 4: FAQs about Discord Logo and Icon](#part4)

## Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker

We’ve picked out some of the best free logo makers, so you can customize your own Discord server logo.

### 1  Logo.Bot

[Logo.Bot](https://www.logo.bot/) uses AI to generate your logo for you, so that you don’t need to worry about drawing anything. It can create a professional logo that you can easily download to use for your Discord server.

Firstly, it’ll ask for your ‘Company’ information – just use the name and description of your Discord server.

![Discord Logo Maker - Logo Bot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fill-in-company-info-logo-bot.jpg)

You’ll then be asked to choose a colour scheme, so pick one that is either relevant to your server or that you simply like. You can pick up at most 3 colors.

![Discord Logo Maker - Logo Bot - select color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-color-logo-bot.jpg)

Next, it’ll give you a list of icons to choose from based on your details already entered, but you can still search for new keywords if you want. Choose up to five icons.

![ Logo Bot icon Preference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-icon-preference.jpg)

Logo Bot will then generate 3 logos based on the information provided before. You can then edit your favourite options using the site’s built-in tools.

![ Logo Bot preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-preview.jpg)

Once you’re done, you can download a free version of your logo as a low-resolution JPG. The problem is that it’ll come with a watermark. If you want the version that is best suited to Discord without a watermark, you’ll need to pay a one-off fee of $20.

![ Logo Bot editing interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-editing-interface.jpg)

### 2  MyBrandNewLogo

[MyBrandNewLogo](https://mybrandnewlogo.com/) is another option that makes it simple to create Discord logos. They even have a specialist tool just for Discord. You’ll start by giving the name of your server (‘Company’) again.

![ MyBrandNewLogo interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-start-interface.jpg)

Then, you can enter some keywords to help it choose the icons to use as part of your logo.

With MyBrandNewLogo, the colour options are slightly more limited than with Logo.Bot, but you can also ask it to surprise you if you aren’t too fussed about the colour to use.

![ MyBrandNewLogo select color ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-select-color.jpg)

From there, you’ll again be shown a mix of icons and fonts combined to create a logo. You can then edit the layout of your logo, the background, add a slogan, change the icon and more to tailor it to your exact specifications.

![ MyBrandNewLogo editing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-editing-interface.jpg)

Unfortunately again you do need to sign up and pay to download your logo. A basic package with one low-res file is €20, while the Professional pack costs €50.

![ MyBrandNewLogo purchase interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-perchase-interface.jpg)

### 3  Logo.com

The third option is <https://logo.com/>. Here you dive straight in – as soon as you’ve entered your Discord server name. You will see a list of logos that you can use as a base design. So it automatically reads your server name and searches for icons related to the term. For the generated logo files, click the Custmoize button to adjust.

![ Logo.com interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-generated-logos.jpg)

You can then work your way down the list on the left, editing the icons to decide where you want it to live, and how big it should be. You can adjust its design, the icons on the logo, the color and the colour themes of your logo, the text, including the font and any changes to how it’s displayed.

![ Logo.com editing interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-editing-interface.jpg)

Once done, you can then preview your final logo. And yet again, you need to pay to download the full version. It’s $19.99 for a high-res PNG and JPG, but if you want a scalable Vector you need to pay $59.99 for the Starter Kit.

### 4  BrandCrowd

[BrandCrowd](https://www.brandcrowd.com/) is another logo creation site you could use, where again you simply enter your Discord server name and it’ll instantly generate icons for you to customize. Unlike Logo.com it doesn’t have a simple step-by-step editor, but instead it’s a lot more powerful, with various tools you can use to adjust shadows, layers and more.

![ BrandCrowd logo maker interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-interface.jpg)

Once you’ve played with the editor, you can click Preview to see how it’ll look on a dummy website (or even on merch), then Download to sign up and access the files…but again they are hidden behind a paywall. BrandCrowd is one of the more expensive options too – a one off fee is $45 to get the high res PNG and JPG as well as vector files, or you can subscribe for $15 per month to unlock unlimited edits and downloads. The previews are watermarked to prevent you from just taking them.

![ BrandCrowd logo maker editing interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-editing-interface.jpg)

### 5  Kapwing

The final recommendation is [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/explore/discord-server-icon-maker-512x512-pixels). Kapwing is, by far, the most comprehensive tool we’ve suggested so far. It isn’t just for creating logos, but working on all kinds of exportable content. The link we’ve included will take you straight to a dedicated workspace for Discord logos, but you’ll then need to upload all of your own imagery (although you can search Kapwing’s own resource collection) and make changes. It requires more skill, but the end results are more professional.

Using the menu at the top, you can play with text, add extra elements, or use the image tool to upload your own files or search Kapwing’s database.

![ Kapwing logo maker editing interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-logo-editing-interface.jpg)

Once you’ve edited your logo, it’s already pre-set to download at 512 x 512\. You’ll just need to create an account to access your download without a watermark, but it is free. The only drawback is that files are only available as JPG or GIF – so you can’t use a PNG with a transparent background.

Unfortunately, most of the ‘free’ online tools for creating Discord server logos aren’t actually free, or they come with limitations. There are other options than using online tools to create a logo however.

## Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites

Rather than creating your own logo, you might want a helping hand – these download sites let you choose an existing icon, and edit it to your own tastes.

### 1  Icons8

[Icons8](https://icons8.com/) is by far the best option of all the free icon download sites. It’s really easy to use, with clear categorization to make finding the perfect logo easier. You can download each icon in PNG or SVG format (or even PDF, if you wanted to for some reason) and customize the size. You can embed the HTML directly and, if you download the Lunacy editor, make tweaks to it before you download it. It’s super simple, and the only minor drawback is you’ll need to register an account, but it’s free.

![ Icons8 Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons8-discord-icons-download.jpg)

### 2  Iconfinder

[Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) is also relatively easy to navigate, and it also lets you download a PNG or SVG version of the file in a size that you prefer. You can’t edit, nor can you embed the HTML, and many of the icons are behind a paywall. However when you do find a free one, you can download it without a subscription.

![ Iconfinder  Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iconfinder-discord-icon.jpg)

### 3  BrandEPS

[BrandEPS](https://www.brandeps.com/) is another popular name for icon downloading but it specializes in existing brand logos. If you want something distinct and unique, you won’t find it here. But if your Discord server is about an existing brand, you can probably download its logo here in either a vector EPS or as part of a zip file with SVG, PNG and JPG versions. No need to sign up.

![ BrandEPS Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/brandeps-discord-logo-vector.jpg)

### 4  FreePNGLogos

[FreePNGLogos](https://www.freepnglogos.com/) is another database of existing company icons and logos, and as you can probably guess from the name, they’re available to download as PNG files. The sizes are limited to the size it’s been uploaded as, and there’s no easy way to browse, you’ll need to search using key terms and hope you find something suitable.

![ FreePNGLogos Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/freepnglogos-discord-logo-png.jpg)

### 5  SeekLogo

Finally, [SeekLogo](https://seeklogo.com/) has a large database of corporate logos but they’re not optimized icons, they’re full size logos including full business names. Downloads are mainly in SVG format, and again the option to browse is minimal, you’ll be relying on search terms and the categorization of icons isn’t the most intuitive.

![ SeekLogo Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seeklogo-discord.jpg)

## Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel - Tips

When you’re naming your server, a longer name might be harder to remember. If you can create a name that you can then abbreviate, you can include the abbreviation in your logo design, so it’s even easier to find your server. Even better, if it can be an acronym (an abbreviation that also forms its own short word) then it’ll be even more memorable.

The other key tip when creating your Discord server logo is to embrace your creativity! Don’t be scared to really make your logo stand out, especially when it’s around a topic that other Discord servers may exist for. You need to make it easy for your server logo to be understood and remembered, and a bold logo is ideal.

## FAQs

#### 1\. What is a Discord Logo?

A **Discord logo** is an icon that’s associated with your Discord server. For any Discord user, the servers they’re a member of are listed by logo, so making a distinctive one that is clearly associated with your server is important for helping people to easily find the server they’re looking for.

#### 2\. What is the Best Size for Discord Channel Logos?

The size of your Discord logo is important, because if it’s too small then it means the logo will be poor quality, while if it’s too large then finer details just won’t be visible – the logo is only ever shown as a small icon. Aim for 512 x 512 pixels.

#### 3\. What is the Best Discord Logo Shape?

Discord logos are displayed as circles, so the easiest way to make sure your logo is properly displayed is to create it as a circle. If you upload a logo in a different shape, you risk having part of your logo cut off, or it being centered incorrectly.

#### 4\. How to Change the Server Logo on Discord?

When you first create your Discord server, you’ll be shown a ‘Getting started’ list where one of the actions is to personalize the server with an icon.

If you’ve already established your Discord server and no longer see this option, then you can simply right-click on your server to find a menu option for the server settings, where you’ll also find the option to update your server logo.

![ MyBrandNewLogo editing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-editing-interface.jpg)

Unfortunately again you do need to sign up and pay to download your logo. A basic package with one low-res file is €20, while the Professional pack costs €50.

![ MyBrandNewLogo purchase interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-perchase-interface.jpg)

### 3  Logo.com

The third option is <https://logo.com/>. Here you dive straight in – as soon as you’ve entered your Discord server name. You will see a list of logos that you can use as a base design. So it automatically reads your server name and searches for icons related to the term. For the generated logo files, click the Custmoize button to adjust.

![ Logo.com interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-generated-logos.jpg)

You can then work your way down the list on the left, editing the icons to decide where you want it to live, and how big it should be. You can adjust its design, the icons on the logo, the color and the colour themes of your logo, the text, including the font and any changes to how it’s displayed.

![ Logo.com editing interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-editing-interface.jpg)

Once done, you can then preview your final logo. And yet again, you need to pay to download the full version. It’s $19.99 for a high-res PNG and JPG, but if you want a scalable Vector you need to pay $59.99 for the Starter Kit.

### 4  BrandCrowd

[BrandCrowd](https://www.brandcrowd.com/) is another logo creation site you could use, where again you simply enter your Discord server name and it’ll instantly generate icons for you to customize. Unlike Logo.com it doesn’t have a simple step-by-step editor, but instead it’s a lot more powerful, with various tools you can use to adjust shadows, layers and more.

![ BrandCrowd logo maker interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-interface.jpg)

Once you’ve played with the editor, you can click Preview to see how it’ll look on a dummy website (or even on merch), then Download to sign up and access the files…but again they are hidden behind a paywall. BrandCrowd is one of the more expensive options too – a one off fee is $45 to get the high res PNG and JPG as well as vector files, or you can subscribe for $15 per month to unlock unlimited edits and downloads. The previews are watermarked to prevent you from just taking them.

![ BrandCrowd logo maker editing interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-editing-interface.jpg)

### 5  Kapwing

The final recommendation is [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/explore/discord-server-icon-maker-512x512-pixels). Kapwing is, by far, the most comprehensive tool we’ve suggested so far. It isn’t just for creating logos, but working on all kinds of exportable content. The link we’ve included will take you straight to a dedicated workspace for Discord logos, but you’ll then need to upload all of your own imagery (although you can search Kapwing’s own resource collection) and make changes. It requires more skill, but the end results are more professional.

Using the menu at the top, you can play with text, add extra elements, or use the image tool to upload your own files or search Kapwing’s database.

![ Kapwing logo maker editing interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-logo-editing-interface.jpg)

Once you’ve edited your logo, it’s already pre-set to download at 512 x 512\. You’ll just need to create an account to access your download without a watermark, but it is free. The only drawback is that files are only available as JPG or GIF – so you can’t use a PNG with a transparent background.

Unfortunately, most of the ‘free’ online tools for creating Discord server logos aren’t actually free, or they come with limitations. There are other options than using online tools to create a logo however.

## Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites

Rather than creating your own logo, you might want a helping hand – these download sites let you choose an existing icon, and edit it to your own tastes.

### 1  Icons8

[Icons8](https://icons8.com/) is by far the best option of all the free icon download sites. It’s really easy to use, with clear categorization to make finding the perfect logo easier. You can download each icon in PNG or SVG format (or even PDF, if you wanted to for some reason) and customize the size. You can embed the HTML directly and, if you download the Lunacy editor, make tweaks to it before you download it. It’s super simple, and the only minor drawback is you’ll need to register an account, but it’s free.

![ Icons8 Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons8-discord-icons-download.jpg)

### 2  Iconfinder

[Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) is also relatively easy to navigate, and it also lets you download a PNG or SVG version of the file in a size that you prefer. You can’t edit, nor can you embed the HTML, and many of the icons are behind a paywall. However when you do find a free one, you can download it without a subscription.

![ Iconfinder  Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iconfinder-discord-icon.jpg)

### 3  BrandEPS

[BrandEPS](https://www.brandeps.com/) is another popular name for icon downloading but it specializes in existing brand logos. If you want something distinct and unique, you won’t find it here. But if your Discord server is about an existing brand, you can probably download its logo here in either a vector EPS or as part of a zip file with SVG, PNG and JPG versions. No need to sign up.

![ BrandEPS Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/brandeps-discord-logo-vector.jpg)

### 4  FreePNGLogos

[FreePNGLogos](https://www.freepnglogos.com/) is another database of existing company icons and logos, and as you can probably guess from the name, they’re available to download as PNG files. The sizes are limited to the size it’s been uploaded as, and there’s no easy way to browse, you’ll need to search using key terms and hope you find something suitable.

![ FreePNGLogos Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/freepnglogos-discord-logo-png.jpg)

### 5  SeekLogo

Finally, [SeekLogo](https://seeklogo.com/) has a large database of corporate logos but they’re not optimized icons, they’re full size logos including full business names. Downloads are mainly in SVG format, and again the option to browse is minimal, you’ll be relying on search terms and the categorization of icons isn’t the most intuitive.

![ SeekLogo Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seeklogo-discord.jpg)

## Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel - Tips

When you’re naming your server, a longer name might be harder to remember. If you can create a name that you can then abbreviate, you can include the abbreviation in your logo design, so it’s even easier to find your server. Even better, if it can be an acronym (an abbreviation that also forms its own short word) then it’ll be even more memorable.

The other key tip when creating your Discord server logo is to embrace your creativity! Don’t be scared to really make your logo stand out, especially when it’s around a topic that other Discord servers may exist for. You need to make it easy for your server logo to be understood and remembered, and a bold logo is ideal.

## FAQs

#### 1\. What is a Discord Logo?

A **Discord logo** is an icon that’s associated with your Discord server. For any Discord user, the servers they’re a member of are listed by logo, so making a distinctive one that is clearly associated with your server is important for helping people to easily find the server they’re looking for.

#### 2\. What is the Best Size for Discord Channel Logos?

The size of your Discord logo is important, because if it’s too small then it means the logo will be poor quality, while if it’s too large then finer details just won’t be visible – the logo is only ever shown as a small icon. Aim for 512 x 512 pixels.

#### 3\. What is the Best Discord Logo Shape?

Discord logos are displayed as circles, so the easiest way to make sure your logo is properly displayed is to create it as a circle. If you upload a logo in a different shape, you risk having part of your logo cut off, or it being centered incorrectly.

#### 4\. How to Change the Server Logo on Discord?

When you first create your Discord server, you’ll be shown a ‘Getting started’ list where one of the actions is to personalize the server with an icon.

If you’ve already established your Discord server and no longer see this option, then you can simply right-click on your server to find a menu option for the server settings, where you’ll also find the option to update your server logo.

Discord’s a great tool for getting together with people who share your interests and sharing content, ideas and discussions. The only thing is, most people have quite a few interests, and so your server is likely to be fighting for attention amongst many other servers. Users can join up to 100, after all. So, a good **Discord server logo** is essential, as it makes it easier for your server to stand out and be found. This article will look at the best free Discord server logo makers.

* [Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker](#part1)
* [Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites](#part2)
* [Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel Tips](#part3)
* [Part 4: FAQs about Discord Logo and Icon](#part4)

## Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker

We’ve picked out some of the best free logo makers, so you can customize your own Discord server logo.

### 1  Logo.Bot

[Logo.Bot](https://www.logo.bot/) uses AI to generate your logo for you, so that you don’t need to worry about drawing anything. It can create a professional logo that you can easily download to use for your Discord server.

Firstly, it’ll ask for your ‘Company’ information – just use the name and description of your Discord server.

![Discord Logo Maker - Logo Bot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fill-in-company-info-logo-bot.jpg)

You’ll then be asked to choose a colour scheme, so pick one that is either relevant to your server or that you simply like. You can pick up at most 3 colors.

![Discord Logo Maker - Logo Bot - select color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-color-logo-bot.jpg)

Next, it’ll give you a list of icons to choose from based on your details already entered, but you can still search for new keywords if you want. Choose up to five icons.

![ Logo Bot icon Preference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-icon-preference.jpg)

Logo Bot will then generate 3 logos based on the information provided before. You can then edit your favourite options using the site’s built-in tools.

![ Logo Bot preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-preview.jpg)

Once you’re done, you can download a free version of your logo as a low-resolution JPG. The problem is that it’ll come with a watermark. If you want the version that is best suited to Discord without a watermark, you’ll need to pay a one-off fee of $20.

![ Logo Bot editing interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-editing-interface.jpg)

### 2  MyBrandNewLogo

[MyBrandNewLogo](https://mybrandnewlogo.com/) is another option that makes it simple to create Discord logos. They even have a specialist tool just for Discord. You’ll start by giving the name of your server (‘Company’) again.

![ MyBrandNewLogo interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-start-interface.jpg)

Then, you can enter some keywords to help it choose the icons to use as part of your logo.

With MyBrandNewLogo, the colour options are slightly more limited than with Logo.Bot, but you can also ask it to surprise you if you aren’t too fussed about the colour to use.

![ MyBrandNewLogo select color ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-select-color.jpg)

From there, you’ll again be shown a mix of icons and fonts combined to create a logo. You can then edit the layout of your logo, the background, add a slogan, change the icon and more to tailor it to your exact specifications.

![ MyBrandNewLogo editing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-editing-interface.jpg)

Unfortunately again you do need to sign up and pay to download your logo. A basic package with one low-res file is €20, while the Professional pack costs €50.

Discord is the creation of gamers, but it shouldn’t scare you off. This free video and text chat service is now a prominent platform for anyone looking to start public or private communities.

Discord lets friends communicate directly via video, voice, or text and join servers where larger communities can hang up.

However, any online community can access the features Discord provides.

In this guide, we're going to dive into how to create your aesthetic **Discord PFP** beginning with the requirements, top Discord PFPs 2021, and a tool to create your own PFP for Discord.

* [Part 1: An Introduction to PFP for Discord](#part1)
* [Part 2: Best 5 Discord PFP](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Design a Discord PFP Avatar in Filmora?](#part3)
* [Part 4: Best 3 Websites to Grow Your Discord Server PFP](#part4)

## **Part 1: An Introduction to PFP for Discord**

Every element on any social platform contributes to the overall user’s impression. His profile picture or Discord PFP is one of the most effective elements that go a long way towards branding.

**Note**: Discord users can only use a single avatar or profile picture on the platform and can't switch between servers.

Keeping this in mind, selecting a cool PFP for Discord helps you represent yourself everywhere on the Discord platform.

#### Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance

Like all other online communication platforms, Discord has rules regarding the suitability of specific images and the use of an avatar.

Firstly, you must know the size limit of images which shouldn’t be too large as it can affect the channel. On the other hand, too small images may look bad and are not legible due to pixelization.

The ideal images size for your Discord PFP is at least 512 x 512 pixels – enough to be visible and far above the 180 x 180-pixel minimum.

Discord allows photographs and various types of cartoon images, memes, and illustrations and accepts JPG and the Discord GIF PFP.

Also, there are community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your Discord PFP submission might get rejected for failing to meet Discord’s terms and conditions.

No NSFW images are allowed on Discord. Explicit nudity or pornographic content is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality or showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions.

## **Part 2: Best 5 Discord PFP**

Discord is overrun with anime/videogame and other cool PFP for Discord. If you’re unfamiliar with either of these, selecting a PFP for Discord can be a challenge.

So today, we have devised a selection of the 5 best of what we believe are the best Discord profile pictures.

#### 1. My Hero Academia – Midoriya Izuku

![my hero academia discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/my-hero-academia-discord.jpg)

Source: alrigh.com

This is a lowkey one. This picture of a young Midoriya Izuku gives a very tired and sleepy vibe. The poor child doesn’t know what the future holds for him.

#### 2. Re:Zero – Rem-Rin

![rem rin discord pfp](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-pfp-rem-rin.jpg)

Source: alrigh.com

Rem, the anime character stole everyone's heart who watched the show in 2016\. With Season 2 over the head, this is the perfect opportunity to show that you're on team Rem.

#### 3. Kermit The Frog – Everyone Loves Kermit

![kermit frog discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/kermit-frog-discord.jpg)

We all love Kermit, the frog. Use his smiling picture to make everyone's day just a tad bit better.

#### 4. Shrek – Meme Face

![shrek discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shrek-discord.jpg)

If cuteness isn't up your alley, here's a funny profile picture. Poor Shrek, what have they done to your beautiful face.

#### 5. Persona 5 – Joker

![discord pfp persona 5 joker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-pfp-persona-joker.jpg)

If you're a Persona franchise fan of the Persona franchise, I offer this profile picture to you. The joker, looking as stunning as always.

## **Part 3: How to Design a Discord PFP Avatar in Filmora?**

If you are also among the users who decide to create custom anime Discord PFPor other PFP for Discord, this option is highly advisable to unveil your creative skills.

It is an effort to make a fantastic Discord PFPor avatar that will be unique and exactly narrates your story behind the brand. You can use many different software tools for this purpose, but since the task is effortless, you can use an accessible and practical program such as Filmora.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The process of designing a PFP for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complicated and consists of just a few simple steps.

Begin by selecting or choosing the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be a real-life photo or an animated avatar. You can download from some discord PFP sites or directly search on Google.

Next, upload the chosen image into a new project and then resize it to fit preferred Discord dimensions. To modify the shape, click **Effects** \-> **Utility** \-> **Image Mask** to optimize **PFP for Discord**.

![create discord avatar Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-overlay-image-mask-discord-profile-wondershare-filmora.jpg)

By adding overlays to the primary image, you can further enhance its visual or textual elements to customize the Discord PFPavatar.

And, you can also consider using Discord GIF PFPsto get maximum attention. A GIF avatar that jumps off the page in every chat you are a part of highlights a strong vibe of creativity.

## **Part 4: Best 3 Websites to Grow Your Discord Server PFP**

There are different ways to carry our Discord server growth, and one of them is to submit your Discord server to server directories or websites that allow you to post a listing for your server.

### 1\. [Disboard](https://disboard.org/servers)

![discord server pfp disboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-server-pfp-disboard.jpg)

Disboard is one of the demanding server listing sites out there, and

As severs here are browsed by category, ensure that you select the correct category while adding it to your listing.

No matter you have a music server or a gaming server, there's sure to be a category for your server, and if not, there's also an "other" server category, so fear not!

### 2.[Top.gg](https://top.gg/servers)

![top gg discord server](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-gg-discord-server.jpg)

Top.gg, which is a bot, is another best server listing site. It helps you submit listings for both your servers and bots with a fantastic user interface.

The listings display the number of emotes available, the voting mechanism, as well as your server's description.

Discord is the creation of gamers, but it shouldn’t scare you off. This free video and text chat service is now a prominent platform for anyone looking to start public or private communities.

Discord lets friends communicate directly via video, voice, or text and join servers where larger communities can hang up.

However, any online community can access the features Discord provides.

In this guide, we're going to dive into how to create your aesthetic **Discord PFP** beginning with the requirements, top Discord PFPs 2021, and a tool to create your own PFP for Discord.

* [Part 2: Best 5 Discord PFP](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Design a Discord PFP Avatar in Filmora?](#part3)
* [Part 4: Best 3 Websites to Grow Your Discord Server PFP](#part4)

## **Part 1: An Introduction to PFP for Discord**

Every element on any social platform contributes to the overall user’s impression. His profile picture or Discord PFP is one of the most effective elements that go a long way towards branding.

**Note**: Discord users can only use a single avatar or profile picture on the platform and can't switch between servers.

Keeping this in mind, selecting a cool PFP for Discord helps you represent yourself everywhere on the Discord platform.

#### Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance

Like all other online communication platforms, Discord has rules regarding the suitability of specific images and the use of an avatar.

Firstly, you must know the size limit of images which shouldn’t be too large as it can affect the channel. On the other hand, too small images may look bad and are not legible due to pixelization.

The ideal images size for your Discord PFP is at least 512 x 512 pixels – enough to be visible and far above the 180 x 180-pixel minimum.

Discord allows photographs and various types of cartoon images, memes, and illustrations and accepts JPG and the Discord GIF PFP.

Also, there are community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your Discord PFP submission might get rejected for failing to meet Discord’s terms and conditions.

No NSFW images are allowed on Discord. Explicit nudity or pornographic content is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality or showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions.

## **Part 2: Best 5 Discord PFP**

Discord is overrun with anime/videogame and other cool PFP for Discord. If you’re unfamiliar with either of these, selecting a PFP for Discord can be a challenge.

So today, we have devised a selection of the 5 best of what we believe are the best Discord profile pictures.

#### 1. My Hero Academia – Midoriya Izuku

![my hero academia discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/my-hero-academia-discord.jpg)

This is a lowkey one. This picture of a young Midoriya Izuku gives a very tired and sleepy vibe. The poor child doesn’t know what the future holds for him.

#### 2. Re:Zero – Rem-Rin

![rem rin discord pfp](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-pfp-rem-rin.jpg)

Source: alrigh.com

Rem, the anime character stole everyone's heart who watched the show in 2016\. With Season 2 over the head, this is the perfect opportunity to show that you're on team Rem.

#### 3. Kermit The Frog – Everyone Loves Kermit

![kermit frog discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/kermit-frog-discord.jpg)

We all love Kermit, the frog. Use his smiling picture to make everyone's day just a tad bit better.

#### 4. Shrek – Meme Face

![shrek discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shrek-discord.jpg)

If cuteness isn't up your alley, here's a funny profile picture. Poor Shrek, what have they done to your beautiful face.

#### 5. Persona 5 – Joker

![discord pfp persona 5 joker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-pfp-persona-joker.jpg)

If you're a Persona franchise fan of the Persona franchise, I offer this profile picture to you. The joker, looking as stunning as always.

## **Part 3: How to Design a Discord PFP Avatar in Filmora?**

If you are also among the users who decide to create custom anime Discord PFPor other PFP for Discord, this option is highly advisable to unveil your creative skills.

It is an effort to make a fantastic Discord PFPor avatar that will be unique and exactly narrates your story behind the brand. You can use many different software tools for this purpose, but since the task is effortless, you can use an accessible and practical program such as Filmora.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The process of designing a PFP for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complicated and consists of just a few simple steps.

Begin by selecting or choosing the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be a real-life photo or an animated avatar. You can download from some discord PFP sites or directly search on Google.

Next, upload the chosen image into a new project and then resize it to fit preferred Discord dimensions. To modify the shape, click **Effects** \-> **Utility** \-> **Image Mask** to optimize **PFP for Discord**.

![create discord avatar Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-overlay-image-mask-discord-profile-wondershare-filmora.jpg)

By adding overlays to the primary image, you can further enhance its visual or textual elements to customize the Discord PFPavatar.

And, you can also consider using Discord GIF PFPsto get maximum attention. A GIF avatar that jumps off the page in every chat you are a part of highlights a strong vibe of creativity.

## **Part 4: Best 3 Websites to Grow Your Discord Server PFP**

There are different ways to carry our Discord server growth, and one of them is to submit your Discord server to server directories or websites that allow you to post a listing for your server.

### 1\. [Disboard](https://disboard.org/servers)

![discord server pfp disboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-server-pfp-disboard.jpg)

Disboard is one of the demanding server listing sites out there, and

As severs here are browsed by category, ensure that you select the correct category while adding it to your listing.

No matter you have a music server or a gaming server, there's sure to be a category for your server, and if not, there's also an "other" server category, so fear not!

### 2.[Top.gg](https://top.gg/servers)

![top gg discord server](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-gg-discord-server.jpg)

Top.gg, which is a bot, is another best server listing site. It helps you submit listings for both your servers and bots with a fantastic user interface.

The listings display the number of emotes available, the voting mechanism, as well as your server's description.

Servers categorize through tags, including Anime, Music, and 30 plus other categories to explore better.

A cool feature of the site is the users' comments on the custom server listing pages so that you can enjoy a great community.

### 3\. [Discord Servers.com](https://discordservers.com/server/536415342411644929)
