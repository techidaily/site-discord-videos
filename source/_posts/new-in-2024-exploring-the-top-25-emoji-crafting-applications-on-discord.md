The good thing about Discord is that it's for everyone, regardless of the platform, device, or OS they may be using.

These Discord emoji maker applications are easy to use, intelligently designed, and, best of all, can be used on both iPhone and Android devices:

### 1\.  BITMOJI

This includes changing or adjusting the avatar features such as eyebrows and hairstyle to face type and clothing.

Once you've created ZMoji emojis for yourself, you can download them and send them over to your Discord server for upload.

ZMoji keyboard, an extension of the ZMoji application, is a must if you love animated emojis. It offers an extensive range of stickers, and you won't run out of options anytime soon.
