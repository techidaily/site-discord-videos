If you don’t want to go through the hassle of adding an emoji manually, you can just copy and paste one to your status. How to do it? Follow these steps:

**Step 3:** Go back to your Discord Nitro page and open the status setting. There, on the emoji section, paste the emoji that you have copied from another site.

## Part 4: How to Add Animated Emojis to Discord Status?

Apart from the basic emojis, you can also add animated emojis to your Discord Status to make your status look even better. Here are the steps to follow to add an animated emoji:

**Step 3:** Then click install better Discord and hit the next button. Choose the Discord version that you currently have installed.

**Step 4:** Open Discord and click on the user settings. There, you will see the Better Discord section. Next, click on the Plugin option. Now, close the Discord window and drag the animated status dot plugin into the plugin folder that opened after clicking on the Plugin option.

**Step 5:** Go to Discord again, and you will see the Animated Status option. Enable it and click on the gear icon. To add an animated emoji, click on the + icon. Next, you will see a Nitro ID field. Then, go to a chat page and click on the emoji option.

**Step 6:** Look at the emoji that you like and memorize the animated emoji name. Press \\ followed by the name of the emoji. Now, copy the whole text and paste it again. You will see a few numbers; that’s the Nitro ID for the emoji. Copy the number only, go back to the Animated plugin and paste it on the Nitro ID field. Go back to the Nitro page again, and you will see the animated emoji on your status.

First, let's understand discord before you look for funny or cool **discord names**.

Regarding the origin, Discord allows you and different individuals to text each other. Here, almost every group is named a "server." All in all, it's more of a standard version of Slack for ease of understanding.

Servers packed with different text channels and voice channels are places where you can interact with each other. Moreover, it also assists users to share recordings, web connections, pictures, music, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. Thus, having good Discord names is more of a necessity than a luxury!

In this guide, you will gather all the cool and funny Discord names collected and crafted after an intensive amount of research.
