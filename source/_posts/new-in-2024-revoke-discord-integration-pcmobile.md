## Part 1: How To Delete A Discord Account Permanently?

Are you done with a game, scared about your data, or just bored with the app? No problem! If you want to learn how to delete your discord account, look no further.

But before doing so, you’ll have to do two quick things:

* Reassign ‘administrative rights’ of the servers
* Completely delete them

The only reason you will have to think about these things is if you assumed responsibility for any server.

Without further ado, here are some easy to follow steps to delete a Discord account permanently:

1. Open the Discord app
2. Sign in to your Discord account and open the user settings option (Cog icon)

![How to Delete Discord Account - Go to My Account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-discord-my-account.jpg)

1. Click the “My Account” option in the user setting menu. At the very bottom of the screen, you’ll see the “delete account” option

![Delete Discord Account Permantely - Account Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-delete-account-option.jpg)

1. Click the delete account button to make your Discord account disappear!

However, if you’ve activated 2FA, you may also be asked to put your password and 2FA code.

Also, if you want to delete your account permanently, there are some things you need to do before completing the process.

As mentioned before, if you’re the server’s owner, you’ll have to either delete your server or transfer its ownership to a trusted source.

For transferring ownership on Discord, follow these steps:

1. Open the Discord app
2. Click the “server name,” and a range of options will open; then click “server setting”
3. At the bottom-left of the screen, click the ‘members’ option below “User Management”
4. Here you’ll make the critical decision of who gets the keys to your kingdom. Once you decide who to transfer the ownership to, click the “3 vertical dots”
5. As the “dialog menu” opens, click “Transfer Ownership”

Once it’s completed, you’ll become a regular server member. Your access to the server will be limited and as per the set position.

On the other hand, if you don’t want to transfer its ownership to someone else, you can also delete it.

Here’s how you can delete the server to complete the process of deleting your Discord account:

1. Click the “Server Name” again
2. Within the several options, click the “Server Settings.”
3. At the bottom-left of your window, click the “Delete Server” option in the “User Management” section.

![Delete Discord Server to Delete Account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-discord-server-account.jpg)

1. Once clicked, the system will ask you to enter the account password to delete your server (or servers) from existence altogether

Like the primary Discord account deletion process, if you have enabled 2FA on this account, you’ll have to put in the code to get things completed.

After this, you’ll be asked one more time to click the “delete server” button before it is completely deleted. Keep in mind that you’ll have 14 days time to recover your Discord account. Once the two-week time passes, you won’t be able to retrieve or sign in to your account.

Once the account is deleted, the username will show up as “deleteduser 0000” or something similar to this. However, users you have texted via your account will still see your texts.

## Part 2: How to Delete Discord Account From iPhone And Android?

3. Select “My Account”
4. Below the “Account Management” option, choose “Delete Account” and put your password and 2FA (if you have set it up)

## Part 3: How To Disable Discord Account On Desktop Computer?

Deleting the account means you won’t be able to use it further, whereas disabling the account normally means you’re taking a little break.

So, if you don’t want to remove or delete your account entirely but only want it gone for some time, choose the disable option.

Here’s how you can disable a Discord account on a desktop computer:

1. Open the app on your window PC/Mac and then log in to your Discord account

1. Click the “Disable Account” option, and it will be disabled.

#### **What’s The Difference Between Disabling And Deleting A Discord Account?**

Disabling the account means you can recover it anytime you want, unlike deleting the account where you only have a 14-day restoration window. Additionally, when the account is disabled, you won’t receive notifications, but you will still get “friend requests.”

## Part 4: How To Disable Discord Account On Mobile?

3. Tap on the “My Account” option in the “User Settings” menu

1. Click the delete account button to make your Discord account disappear!

However, if you’ve activated 2FA, you may also be asked to put your password and 2FA code.

Also, if you want to delete your account permanently, there are some things you need to do before completing the process.

As mentioned before, if you’re the server’s owner, you’ll have to either delete your server or transfer its ownership to a trusted source.

For transferring ownership on Discord, follow these steps:

1. Open the Discord app
2. Click the “server name,” and a range of options will open; then click “server setting”
3. At the bottom-left of the screen, click the ‘members’ option below “User Management”
4. Here you’ll make the critical decision of who gets the keys to your kingdom. Once you decide who to transfer the ownership to, click the “3 vertical dots”
5. As the “dialog menu” opens, click “Transfer Ownership”

Once it’s completed, you’ll become a regular server member. Your access to the server will be limited and as per the set position.

On the other hand, if you don’t want to transfer its ownership to someone else, you can also delete it.

Here’s how you can delete the server to complete the process of deleting your Discord account:

1. Click the “Server Name” again
2. Within the several options, click the “Server Settings.”
3. At the bottom-left of your window, click the “Delete Server” option in the “User Management” section.

![Delete Discord Server to Delete Account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-discord-server-account.jpg)

1. Once clicked, the system will ask you to enter the account password to delete your server (or servers) from existence altogether

Like the primary Discord account deletion process, if you have enabled 2FA on this account, you’ll have to put in the code to get things completed.

After this, you’ll be asked one more time to click the “delete server” button before it is completely deleted. Keep in mind that you’ll have 14 days time to recover your Discord account. Once the two-week time passes, you won’t be able to retrieve or sign in to your account.

Once the account is deleted, the username will show up as “deleteduser 0000” or something similar to this. However, users you have texted via your account will still see your texts.

## Part 3: How To Disable Discord Account On Desktop Computer?

Deleting the account means you won’t be able to use it further, whereas disabling the account normally means you’re taking a little break.

So, if you don’t want to remove or delete your account entirely but only want it gone for some time, choose the disable option.

Here’s how you can disable a Discord account on a desktop computer:

1. Open the app on your window PC/Mac and then log in to your Discord account
2. Click the “User Settings” option and then go to the “My Account” option within the user settings
3. In the lower corner of your Mac/PC screen, you’ll see the “Disable Account” button next to the “Delete Account” button

1. Click the “Disable Account” option, and it will be disabled.

#### **What’s The Difference Between Disabling And Deleting A Discord Account?**

Disabling the account means you can recover it anytime you want, unlike deleting the account where you only have a 14-day restoration window. Additionally, when the account is disabled, you won’t receive notifications, but you will still get “friend requests.”

## Part 4: How To Disable Discord Account On Mobile?

Disabling your Discord account for Android and iOS isn’t as simple as it is on a Desktop Windows/Mac PC.

Currently, there is no direct way to either delete or disable your Discord account through a mobile device.

Nevertheless, follow the steps below to disable your Discord account on mobile:

2. Tap the cog icon on the lower right corner of the phone
3. Tap on the “My Account” option in the “User Settings” menu
4. You’ll have the choice to either “Delete Account” or “Disable Account.” However, whatever you choose, you’ll be prompted to the support page explaining ways to disable or delete your account
5. To complete disabling process from a mobile device, you’ll have to send a request to the support team, as it’s the only way to disable your account via your smartphone

#### 1\. How Long Does Discord Take To Delete Account?

Typically, once you have completed the entire deletion process, Discord takes approximately 14 to 30 days to process it.

#### 2\. What Happens When You Delete Discord Account?

# How to Reply Message on Discord

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord is a communication app targeted towards gamers. Games such as Fortnite and Among Us – a social deduction game – drove many new users to the platform

It surged in popularity during the pandemic, doubling its active monthly users to 120 million towards the end of 2020.

This popularity comes from the fact that Discord is now also being used by households and workplaces for seamless communication.

Today, we will focus on how the 'discord reply to message' feature works. This feature helps when you are trying to pick out a single message to reply to from a list of messages.

You can also include a link back to the message you respond to, making it easier for other people to follow the conversation.

You can even tag the person you are replying to so that they receive a notification whenever they log on to Discord.

In this article, we will cover the following parts on how to reply to messages on Discord:

* [Part 1: How to Reply to a Specific Message on Discord on Desktop](#part1)
* [Part 2: Replying to a Certain Message on Discord Mobile](#part2)
* [Part 3: Setting up Auto Reply on Discord with Bots](#part3)
* [Part 4: Replying to Messages with Reactions on Discord](#part4)
* [Part 5: Quoting Messages on Discord?](#part5)

## Part 1: How to Reply to a Specific Message on Discord on Desktop

This technique works for both the browser and the desktop applications; use it when replying in different discord channels or direct messaging a friend.

1. Locate the message you wish to reply to

![Reply message on Discord desktop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reply-message-on-discord.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135399/19272" target="_top" id="2135399">

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

1. Hover your cursor on the comment as you see icons on the right of the message
2. Now click on the arrow icon
3. Alternatively, you might have to click on the ellipsis icon (…) if you are replying to a comment by yourself
4. After clicking on the ellipsis icon, choose the "Reply" button
5. Write your reply in the text box. You will now see a banner telling you who you are replying to. There will also be a "@" sign over the text box, which will tag the person you respond to (this can be turned off with a click)
6. After you are done writing, press Enter to send your message. If you wish to discard the reply, you can click on "X."

![cancel  message replying on Discord desktop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cancel-reply-on-discord.jpg)

## Part 2: How to Reply to a Certain Message on Discord Mobile

Replying on the mobile app is similar to Desktop. Here's how to do it:

1. Locate the message you wish to reply to in the Discord app
2. Hold down on the comment until a list of options appears on the screen
3. Choose the "Reply" option

![reply  message  on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reply-discord-message-mobile.jpg)

1. Write your reply in the text box. Like before, the person will be tagged by default, but you can turn this off by tapping the blue "@" sign
2. After you are done writing, send the message using the enter button on your phone or tap "X" to discard the message

After pressing the send button, you should now be able to see your message in the channel.

## Part 3: How to Set Auto Reply on Discord

It may be useful to have an auto-reply feature when handling large servers. Do this by integrating a bot into your Discord server.

Here's an example of how you can implement this feature in your server. In this example, we are going to be using the Dyno bot:

1. First, you need to visit Dyno's [website](https://dyno.gg/bot) and then click on "Join us on Discord"

![auto reply  message on Discord ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-reply-bot-discord-dyno.jpg)

1. Now you will have to sign in to your Discord account from your browser
2. Next, you will have to pick which server you want to invite the bot to
3. From the same screen, you can decide which permissions to assign to the bot. The ones that matter to us are read messages and send messages

![set up permission for bots ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-dyno-permissions-discord.jpg)

1. The last step is to verify that you are not a robot yourself and check I’m not a robot.

![connect bots to Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/connect-to-discord-dyno.jpg)

After this, the Dyno bot will be added to your Discord server. To allow the bot to send messages, you need to visit Dyno's website and turn on the autoresponder, enabling you to set up your auto-reply.

## Part 4: How to Reply to Messages with Reactions on Discord

Discord allows you to react to posts with emojis. To respond with an emoji:

1. Hover your mouse cursor over the message you wish to react to
2. Click the smiley face titled "Add reaction" on the message's far-right

![add reactions to message replying on Discord ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-reactions-reply-message-discord.jpg)

1. After clicking on the "Add reaction" icon, a pop-up will appear, allowing you to choose the emoji you wish to react with.

![choosing reaction in  Discord message replying](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choose-reaction-emoji-discord.jpg)

Furthermore, to react to a message with an emoji that has already been used as a reaction, you can:

1. Click on the emoji, and it would increase the total number of responses by 1
2. Hovering over the emoji will also let you know the names of the people who reacted to the message

## Part 5: How to Quote Messages on Discord?

Quoting messages in Discord is very simple. All you need to do is type > before your quote if it is only a one-liner.

![quote message on Discord ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quote-messages-on-discord.jpg)

On the other hand, multi-line quoting is when you need to quote a paragraph or break between the lines you want to mention. For this, you can:

1. Add > after every line. However, this can become annoying
2. Instead, add >>> at the start of the paragraph you wish to quote

![multiple quote message on Discord ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/multi-line-quoting-discord.jpg)

6. After you are done writing, press Enter to send your message. If you wish to discard the reply, you can click on "X."

## Part 2: How to Reply to a Certain Message on Discord Mobile

Replying on the mobile app is similar to Desktop. Here's how to do it:

1. Locate the message you wish to reply to in the Discord app
2. Hold down on the comment until a list of options appears on the screen
3. Choose the "Reply" option

![reply  message  on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reply-discord-message-mobile.jpg)

1. Write your reply in the text box. Like before, the person will be tagged by default, but you can turn this off by tapping the blue "@" sign
2. After you are done writing, send the message using the enter button on your phone or tap "X" to discard the message

After pressing the send button, you should now be able to see your message in the channel.

## Part 3: How to Set Auto Reply on Discord

It may be useful to have an auto-reply feature when handling large servers. Do this by integrating a bot into your Discord server.

Here's an example of how you can implement this feature in your server. In this example, we are going to be using the Dyno bot:

1. First, you need to visit Dyno's [website](https://dyno.gg/bot) and then click on "Join us on Discord"

![auto reply  message on Discord ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-reply-bot-discord-dyno.jpg)

1. Now you will have to sign in to your Discord account from your browser
2. Next, you will have to pick which server you want to invite the bot to
3. From the same screen, you can decide which permissions to assign to the bot. The ones that matter to us are read messages and send messages

![set up permission for bots ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-dyno-permissions-discord.jpg)

1. The last step is to verify that you are not a robot yourself and check I’m not a robot.

![connect bots to Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/connect-to-discord-dyno.jpg)

After this, the Dyno bot will be added to your Discord server. To allow the bot to send messages, you need to visit Dyno's website and turn on the autoresponder, enabling you to set up your auto-reply.

## Part 4: How to Reply to Messages with Reactions on Discord

Discord allows you to react to posts with emojis. To respond with an emoji:

1. Hover your mouse cursor over the message you wish to react to
2. Click the smiley face titled "Add reaction" on the message's far-right

![add reactions to message replying on Discord ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-reactions-reply-message-discord.jpg)

1. After clicking on the "Add reaction" icon, a pop-up will appear, allowing you to choose the emoji you wish to react with.

Furthermore, to react to a message with an emoji that has already been used as a reaction, you can:

1. Click on the emoji, and it would increase the total number of responses by 1
2. Hovering over the emoji will also let you know the names of the people who reacted to the message

## Part 5: How to Quote Messages on Discord?

Quoting messages in Discord is very simple. All you need to do is type > before your quote if it is only a one-liner.

![quote message on Discord ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quote-messages-on-discord.jpg)

On the other hand, multi-line quoting is when you need to quote a paragraph or break between the lines you want to mention. For this, you can:

1. Add > after every line. However, this can become annoying
2. Instead, add >>> at the start of the paragraph you wish to quote
