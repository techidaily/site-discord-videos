[Discord is a voice and text chat service](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to bring like-minded people together, especially e-sports professionals.

The goal was to provide users with an improved communications platform that could streamline the way people speak in real-time and over the internet.

Originally designed for gamers, the app allowed users to communicate with others who share interests on a given topic.

After a while, the Discord app expanded its reach and included non-gamers as well. Today, it is one of the most popular chatting apps out there.

However, if, for any reason, you want to delete or disable your account for good, you can. In the following articles, you will learn about how to delete your account step by step.

## Part 1: How To Delete A Discord Account Permanently?

Are you done with a game, scared about your data, or just bored with the app? No problem! If you want to learn how to delete your discord account, look no further.

But before doing so, you’ll have to do two quick things:

* Reassign ‘administrative rights’ of the servers
* Completely delete them

The only reason you will have to think about these things is if you assumed responsibility for any server.

Without further ado, here are some easy to follow steps to delete a Discord account permanently:

1. Open the Discord app
2. Sign in to your Discord account and open the user settings option (Cog icon)

![How to Delete Discord Account - Go to My Account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-discord-my-account.jpg)

1. Click the “My Account” option in the user setting menu. At the very bottom of the screen, you’ll see the “delete account” option

![Delete Discord Account Permantely - Account Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-delete-account-option.jpg)

1. Click the delete account button to make your Discord account disappear!

However, if you’ve activated 2FA, you may also be asked to put your password and 2FA code.

Also, if you want to delete your account permanently, there are some things you need to do before completing the process.

As mentioned before, if you’re the server’s owner, you’ll have to either delete your server or transfer its ownership to a trusted source.

For transferring ownership on Discord, follow these steps:

1. Open the Discord app
2. Click the “server name,” and a range of options will open; then click “server setting”
3. At the bottom-left of the screen, click the ‘members’ option below “User Management”
4. Here you’ll make the critical decision of who gets the keys to your kingdom. Once you decide who to transfer the ownership to, click the “3 vertical dots”
5. As the “dialog menu” opens, click “Transfer Ownership”

Once it’s completed, you’ll become a regular server member. Your access to the server will be limited and as per the set position.

On the other hand, if you don’t want to transfer its ownership to someone else, you can also delete it.

Here’s how you can delete the server to complete the process of deleting your Discord account:

1. Click the “Server Name” again
2. Within the several options, click the “Server Settings.”
3. At the bottom-left of your window, click the “Delete Server” option in the “User Management” section.

![Delete Discord Server to Delete Account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-discord-server-account.jpg)

1. Once clicked, the system will ask you to enter the account password to delete your server (or servers) from existence altogether

Like the primary Discord account deletion process, if you have enabled 2FA on this account, you’ll have to put in the code to get things completed.

After this, you’ll be asked one more time to click the “delete server” button before it is completely deleted. Keep in mind that you’ll have 14 days time to recover your Discord account. Once the two-week time passes, you won’t be able to retrieve or sign in to your account.

Once the account is deleted, the username will show up as “deleteduser 0000” or something similar to this. However, users you have texted via your account will still see your texts.
