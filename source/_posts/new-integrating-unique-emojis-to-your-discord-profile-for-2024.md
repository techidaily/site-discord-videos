**Step 4:** Lastly, select your preferred status option and proceed. You can also add custom status by clicking on Set a custom status.

## **Part 5: How do you show what game you're playing on Discord?**

Do you know Discord is a hookup outlet where gamers connect? Sound surprising? Yeah, with Discord, you can relate with like-minded gamers using its advanced features and customization options. You can Screen Share, add audio bots, and do lots more for free without hassles. In addition to that, Discord has an automatic detective system that looks at all that's running on your device and mostly recognizes popular verified game, though you can edit unverified games and programs using the steps outlined below.

Sit back and learn how to show off what you're up to in the gaming realm!

### **How to Display Game Status on Discord Desktop**

### **How to Display Game Status on Discord Mobile App**

**Step 1:** Launch the Discord mobile app and click on the three horizontal lines in the top-right corner of the pane to select the profile icon at the bottom-left corner.

**Step 2:** On the new page, scroll down and select the Game Activity option to proceed.

**Step 3:**On the Game Tab, all you've got to do is to toggle the switch to show your current game activity.

## **FAQs About Discord Status**

### **1\. How can you change the Discord status automatically?**

A concise answer to this question is, Discord status cannot be changed automatically, but you can set a time limit that you want a custom text to display on your status. However, the game activity status option can be updated automatically.

### **2\. How can you tell if someone with their status set to offline is online, on Discord?**

Detecting whether someone is online when their Discord status is set to invisible is not a walk in the park. But one unique way to tell if they're online is by spotting them via voice chat or when typing a message.
