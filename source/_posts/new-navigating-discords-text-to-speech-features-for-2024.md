While most users of the popular online messaging and content sharing site Discord rely on simple text to communicate, there are numerous situations when using the text-to-speech feature would be quite advantageous. This includes instances when there are language barriers or disabilities to overcome, but also spontaneous moments when users just enjoy hearing each other’s words.

In this article, we will discuss the specifics of activating the TTS function in Discord and using it effectively to improve your communication with other users. By following the detailed instructions provided here, you will be able to learn how to activate text-to-speech on Discord and manage your voice messages on selected servers in the most practical manner.

## Part 1: How to Enable Text-To-Speech Feature in Discord?

Before you can deploy TTS in your chats, you need to change the settings of your profile to enable this option. This isn’t hard to do – just go to the Discord app and select ‘Settings’ from the menu, which will trigger a pop-up window to appear on your screen. Next, you need to find the **Text & Images** section in the App Settings window, then scroll down to find the **Text-to-Speech** option, and finally tick the boxes next to **Allow playback and Usage of TTS** items. After you do this, your Discord will be ready to process your text messages in voice format.

![Discord Text to Speech Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-tts-command-discord-settings.jpg)

To test whether you successfully activated Text-to-Speech, open any chats on your personal server and try typing out a message, followed immediately by the tag /tts. If everything is working correctly, your message should appear on the screen in the text form, accompanied by its voice rendering delivered by an automated module. The timing of the two should be perfectly synchronized so that you hear the message and see the text at exactly the same instance. Otherwise, go back to settings and make sure you activated the TTS option properly or restart your Discord app.

## Part 2: How to Set Up Text-To-Speech Notifications on Discord?

Another practical possibility that can improve your Discord experience is to set up TTS notifications and be immediately informed whenever a fresh message arrives. This can also be done after you change the app parameters from the ‘Settings’ menu. After you see all options, choose ‘App Settings’ and search for the section named ‘Notifications’. By scrolling down, you will reach the item ‘Text-to-Speech notifications’ and after clicking on it you will be given a choice between three options.

![Discord Text to Speech Notification Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-text-to-speech-notification-settings.jpg)

The first option **For all channels** is to enable notifications on all channels on Discord; choosing it will result in a robotic voice reading all messages from all chats, regardless of whether they have a /tts tag. This option can be useful when you want to maximize your accessibility and receive important information instantly.

By picking the second option, **For current selected channel**, you can enable TTS notifications only on the current channel. This action will instruct Discord to have an automated voice read all the incoming messages on the active chat aloud, allowing you to stay in the loop at all times. This possibility works well for people who occasionally do multiple things at once, for example, gamers or streamers who use Discord to stay connected with their fans and friends while they are busy.

Finally, you can choose **Never** to hear any voice messages from your Discord chats never. If you pick this setting, even those messages that were sent with the /tts tag will only be displayed in the text format. This option provides you with peace of mind and prevents spammers from saturating you with voice messages you have no interest in hearing.

## Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech in Discord Chatting?

It’s not very hard to learn how to effectively use the TTS option in your chats on the Discord platform. This communication format is available on all channels that have an activated Text-to-Speech setting, so you can freely add a few messages to be read aloud or completely switch to automated voice format if you so desire. Doing this in practice is very simple – just start your message by typing the tag /tts and then enter your text as you normally would.

![Send  Discord Text to Speech Message](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/send-text-to-speech-tts-message-discord.jpg)

Your TTS message will be reproduced in a voice format by a Discord bot to all participants in the chat who didn’t mute incoming Text-to-Speech chats. An automated voice will say the entire message, and then also pronounce your username to identify the author. At the same time, the message will appear in the chat feed as plain text, so that even those recipients unable to hear it will be able to see the contents.

## Part 4: How to Mute All Text-To-Speech Messages on Discord?

You can also decide to prevent any messages from being played to you in a voice format and receive them as text only. This option is available even if you are not the administrator of the chat server and simply want to customize your own experience. To do this, you need to open the Discord app and enter the Settings menu, before selecting the Text & Images section from App Settings. After this, you need to find the Text-to-Speech sub-menu and open it to find the Allow Playback feature. If you disable this feature, you will effectively mute all incoming TTS messages across all Discord servers you are active on.

![Disable  Discord Text to Speech Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/disable-text-to-speech-tts-discord-settings.jpg)

Please keep in mind that deactivating the aforementioned feature won’t block TTS messages from reaching you, but you will see them as text only. On the other hand, you can’t use the /tts tag to send your own Text-to-Speech while the playback setting is disabled. Nothing is preventing you from turning it back on when you want to have a TTS capacity on Discord again.

## Part 5: Best Text-To-Speech Bots on Discord

One of the reasons why Discord is so popular is that it allows extensive customization through user-made Bots or modules that automatically perform a certain task. There are several great Bots that can be used for Text-to-Speech, so you might consider utilizing one of them.

### 1\. [Text to Speech (TTS)](https://top.gg/bot/527867442748194847)

With many languages supported and a wide range of cool commands, this bot could be the best choice for people who use TTS just for fun.

### 2\. [KD Bot](https://top.gg/bot/414925323197612032)

A very popular option for Text-to-Speech on Discord that lets you choose from more than 100 voices and supports upwards of 100 languages, making it a powerful translation tool.

### 3\. [Fergun](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/680507783359365121)

This multi-language tool responds to more than 100 different commands, so it can be used for a wide variety of purposes with stunning effectiveness.

One of the reasons why Discord is so popular is that it allows extensive customization through user-made Bots or modules that automatically perform a certain task. There are several great Bots that can be used for Text-to-Speech, so you might consider utilizing one of them.

### 1\. [Text to Speech (TTS)](https://top.gg/bot/527867442748194847)

With many languages supported and a wide range of cool commands, this bot could be the best choice for people who use TTS just for fun.

### 2\. [KD Bot](https://top.gg/bot/414925323197612032)

A very popular option for Text-to-Speech on Discord that lets you choose from more than 100 voices and supports upwards of 100 languages, making it a powerful translation tool.

### 3\. [Fergun](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/680507783359365121)

This multi-language tool responds to more than 100 different commands, so it can be used for a wide variety of purposes with stunning effectiveness.

### Frequently asked questions about TTS on Discord

1. **Can I use the Text-to-Speech feature on Discord from a mobile phone?**

Unfortunately, you can’t. Discord works quite well as a text messaging app on mobile platforms, but at this time Text-to-Speech functionality is limited to desktop users.

1. **Why can’t I use Text-to-Speech on a Discord server?**

Discord is packed with great features, but one thing it’s missing is a screen recorder. You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.

Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.

One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.

## Part 1: Best Windows/Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord

If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust [screen recording tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.

### 1. OBS

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.

There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.

### 2. Bandicam

Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.

Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn't involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95\. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.

### 3. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features [screen recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 4. DemoCreator

If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider [Wondershare DemoCreator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/). Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.

You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.

### 5. Camtasia

If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.

However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.

## Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord

If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.

### 2. Screen Capture

One such option is [Screen Capture](https://www.screencapture.com/), which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.

There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

### 3. Clipchamp

If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/). Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.

It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.

### 3. Screencast-o-matic

The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is [Screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder). This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.

The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.

## Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android

If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.

### 1. AZ Screen Recorder

[AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US) is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.

It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.

### 2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots

Another option for Android is [‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US). Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.

The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.

### 3. Record It

If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘[Record It!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545)’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.

The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.

## Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?

If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.

Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.

You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.

If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.

Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.

The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.

However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.

It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.

### 3. Screencast-o-matic

The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is [Screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder). This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.

The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.

## Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android

If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.

### 1. AZ Screen Recorder

[AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US) is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.

It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.

### 2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots

Another option for Android is [‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US). Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.

The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.

### 3. Record It

If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘[Record It!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545)’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.

The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.

## Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?

If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.

Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.

You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.

If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.

Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.

The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord is packed with great features, but one thing it’s missing is a screen recorder. You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.

Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.

One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.

## Part 1: Best Windows/Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord

If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust [screen recording tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.

### 1. OBS

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.

There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.

### 2. Bandicam

Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.

Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn't involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95\. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.

### 3. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features [screen recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 4. DemoCreator

If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider [Wondershare DemoCreator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/). Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.

You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.

### 5. Camtasia

If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.

However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.

## Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord

If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.

### 2. Screen Capture

One such option is [Screen Capture](https://www.screencapture.com/), which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.

There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

### 3. Clipchamp

If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/). Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.

It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.

### 3. Screencast-o-matic

However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool.
