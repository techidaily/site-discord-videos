It can be natural or wild, simple or modern anything of your choice. Avoid mixing multiple themes which might create a sense of confusion to the audience. Just remember that your animated logo should make an impact!

Remember your competitors will also be thinking of animated logos, so how will you grab the attention of users is very important. Remember less is more!
