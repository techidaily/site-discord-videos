Discord is a communication software that allows users, mostly gamers, to communicate in real-time with clear lag-free voice chat and text chat and exchange information. It is available for free but requires you to buy Discord-Nitro to access more features.

## **Part 1: Why You Should Try A Discord Alternative?**

Although Discord is an amazing application and used by the majority of the player base, professionals and even by companies for corporate meetings. There are some points due to which one might prefer something different than what discord has to offer as its main focus is to provide ease for all kinds of gamers.

Here are some reasons that might cause you to look at other alternatives:

* Server Raids
* Less Free File Transfer Size
* Not So Professional UI
* Less Specific Profile Editing
* No Self Hosting
* And more.

## **Part 2: Best Discord Alternative Programs You Should Try**

There is a wide market of programs that can provide you the same features as Discord or features that aren’t in Discord but you need. Below is a list of programs that you can try to find perfect one for you.

### **Discord Alternatives Best For Gamer Chatting**

#### 1  TeamSpeak

TeamSpeak is a proprietary voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) application for audio communication between users on a voice channel, very almost like a call. Users typically use headphones with a microphone. It has been around since 2002 and hence is widely trusted by the community.

![discord alternative for gamers - teamspeak](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/teamspeak-audio-communication-app.jpg)

It allows crystal clear and lag free communication with 3D immersive features that help gamers who play real simulation games like Arma 3 to feel more involved with the radio feature and more. TeamSpeak is available on Window, Mac and on Mobile Devices.

Some of the advantages that TeamSpeak offers that make it better than the rest are:

* Spam Free
* Military Grade Encryption
* Host Private Servers
* Access over 100 add-ons, skins and voice packs
* Cloud-based service that enables you to synchronize your servers, settings, and preferences between devices with ease
* Won’t Provide Your Data to Third Parties
* 3D User Immersive Positioning

You can read more about it’s advantages at: <https://teamspeak.com/en/features/overview/>

#### 2 Mumble

Mumble is a voice IP application primarily designed to be employed by gamers and is analogous to programs like TeamSpeak. Mumble uses a client–server architecture which allows users to speak to each other via an equivalent server. It has a really simple administrative interface and features high sound quality and low latency. It has been around since 2005 but they released the stable version in October 2020.

![discord alternative for gamers - Mumble](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mumble-public-server-list.jpg)

Mumble is quite similar to TeamSpeak in it’s features and abilities. But in addition to that, it provides a large list of features separate to each kind of user from End-users to Hosters.

Users use Mumble for realism with their positional audio. This means that the farther one is, the more difficult it would be to receive their audio signals. And so Eve Online Players have servers with almost 100 active voice participants at a time. Mumbleis available on Window, Mac and on Mobile Devices.

Some more advantages that Mumble offers are:

* Low Latency - Great for Gaming
* Privacy - Always Encrypted Communication

![discord alternative for gamers - Ventrilo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ventrilo-interface.jpg)

Ventrilo is best known for its superior sound quality and minimal use of CPU resources so as to not interfere with normal operations of the pc or during online game competitions. It is also preferred for the straightforward interface that any first time person can very quickly learn because the foremost commonly used features are immediately visible and can be activated with one click of the mouse.

Ventrilo uses a client-server based connection that's always encrypted. User data isn't collected or stored, hence it can't be shared/sold to external entities. All text-chat communications/audio-recordings are stored locally on the Client computer. Ventrilo is available on Windows, Mac and even Linux. As for mobile users, it’s available on Apple Store and also for android but android users will have to download an APK which can be done from its website.

Some Advantages that Ventrilo provides over Discord are:

* A great Discord alternative which boasts of low latency voice calls with a light-weight design

# How to Report Someone on Discord

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord has completely transformed online communication, becoming the preferred platform for gamers, streamers, and reviewers alike.

As of late, it has started integrating with other gaming and streaming services, giving us the streamer mode. With streaming's growing popularity, it's essential to know what the streamer mode is all about.

If you're a gamer, Discord's streamer mode allows you to stream your gaming session to viewers by broadcasting your game to your friends, fans, and even a closed community of enthusiasts.

Many e-gaming professionals have taken up streaming, offering original and valuable content for like-minded individuals. This mode helps them streamline all their communications in one place.

If you're new to Discord’s streamer mode, you need to know what it is, how you can use it to engage with other community members, and the primary security concerns you need to be aware of.

* [Part 1: How to Report Users on Discord Desktop?](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Report Users on Discord Mobile App?](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Kick People on Discord?](#part3)
* [Part 4: FAQs About Discord Reporting](#part4)

For gamers in the modern era, Discord is a household name. The platform has around 120 million active users monthly as of early 2021.

With so many users on the forum, it is normal to have some "bad apples" in the mix. There are trolls, miscreants, and spammers who ruin the experience for everyone else.

You can report them to Discord Trust and Safety team. They would take appropriate action against these nuisances after reviewing evidence.

Reporting helps make healthier communities and allows you to avoid conflicts and outbreaks due to suspicious activity on the platform.

Today we will look into how to report someone on Discord using desktop and mobile devices. Moreover, we will look at other ways to deal with indecent behavior, such as kicking people or banning them.

## Part 1: How to Report Users on Discord Desktop

Before you can report a person to Discord's Trust and Safety team, you will need to enable Discord's developer mode.

Enabling this mode will allow you to obtain the information necessary to file your report.

1. Login to your Discord account on PC or Mac
2. You will see a gear icon next to your username to the bottom left of your screen; click on it

![ Discord User Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

1. There will be a list of options in the sidebar; from here, click on "Appearance"
2. Next, scroll down until you find "Developer Mode" under Advanced; turn it on

![ Turn on Discord Developer Mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-discord-developer-mode.jpg)

After enabling developer mode, you will now need the user ID of the person you are reporting. To get someone's user ID:

1. Right-click on their username
2. From the list of options that appear, choose "Copy ID"
3. Paste this user ID somewhere so that you can access it later

To report a specific message, you need to get the message link as well. For this:

1. Locate the message you want to report
2. Then hover your cursor over it and click on the ellipsis sign (…) on the right side
3. Click on "Copy Message Link"
4. Paste this somewhere so that you can use it later

After collecting the necessary information, go to Discord's website to report it to [Discord's Trust and Safety Team](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket%5Fform%5Fid=360000029731).

You will have to provide your email address and post the two links copied earlier into the description box.

Also, it would help if you gave context regarding your report describing how and what rule was broken. You can also provide any other evidence you may want to present by attaching files in the attachments area.

![ Submit report request on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/submit-discord-user-report-request.jpg)

Now, confirm that you are a human by completing the captcha and then click on "Submit." Discord will contact you via email if action is taken against your complaint.

## Part 2: How to Report Users on Discord on iPhone And Android

Just like on a desktop, you will first need to enable developer mode.

1. After opening Discord on your mobile device, go to user settings by tapping on the gear icon or your profile picture next to your username
2. On iPhone, tap on "Appearance" and then go to "Advanced," whereas on Android, go to "App Settings" and tap "Behavior"

![  report people on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/report-user-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Turn on developer mode by clicking on the slider under the "Chat Behavior" option

Like before, you will now need to obtain the User ID; the process may be slightly different depending on the phone you are using. In general, the steps would be:

1. Open the user's profile by tapping on it
2. Tap on the ellipsis sign (…) in the upper-right of your screen and select "Copy ID"
3. After doing this, paste the ID somewhere you can later access

Follow the steps below to get the message link to report.

1. Go to the message and then hold down on it until a list of options appears
2. On an iPhone, tap on "Copy Message Link." For an android device, click on "Select" and then "Copy To Clipboard"

Now, you can send this information to the [Trust and Safety team](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket%5Fform%5Fid=360000029731) to assess it. To do this:

1. Paste the two links copied earlier in the "Description Box"
2. Provide your email address along with the context behind the situation
3. Click on "Submit"

## Part 3: How to Kick People on Discord

Discord also allows you to take care of improper behavior yourself. If you are a moderator or server owner, you can kick people for violating Discord's guidelines.

However, it is essential to have a reason to kick someone. Otherwise, it may be seen as an abuse of power.

Here are activities to look out for before kicking someone:

* Spam messages
* Harassment
* Sharing child pornography
* Violating IP rights
* Sharing viruses
* Advocating self-harm or suicide
* Distributing gore content or animal cruelty
* Life threats to another user

If you see someone involved in these, you can kick them off your server or report them to moderators or server owners if you don't have kicking authority.

In case the moderators or owners do not act on your complaint, you can always contact the Trust and Safety team.

If you happen to be a moderator or server owner, you have the authority to kick people off your server. Here is how to do it:

1. Go to the correct channel on Discord
2. Find the user from the user list on the right side of the screen
3. Right-click on their username and then select "Kick"
4. Click on "Kick" again to confirm your decision

## Part 4: FAQs About Discord Reporting

There is no need to Google responses to "How do you report someone on Discord," we have answers to the most frequently asked questions:

### Can I Report People on Discord Anonymously?

According to a [moderator on Discord's subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/ave1x3/are%5Freports%5Fanonymous/), information regarding a reported case remains between the T&S team and the reporter. Nothing regarding the complaint is shared with the individual kicked.

### What Happens If I Report Someone on Discord?

After you report someone on Discord, the T&S team goes through the evidence to justify or negate your claims.

Usually, this process takes a long time as the team evaluates whether the problem is part of a broader pattern.

After conducting their research and deciding upon a punishment, the T&S team will contact the offender via email to inform them about their misconduct and the relevant consequences.

In minor offenses, the T&S team will reach out to the reporter and teach them how to block the user rather than take direct action.

### Can You Report Someone on Discord for Being Under 13?

Individuals under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Discord unless they have permission from a parent or guardian. However, it is not very easy to prove that the user is below a certain age.

If you know someone who is undoubtedly underage, then you can report them to the Trust & Safety team by filling out their form and adding evidence to back your claim.

## Part 3: How to Kick People on Discord

Discord also allows you to take care of improper behavior yourself. If you are a moderator or server owner, you can kick people for violating Discord's guidelines.

However, it is essential to have a reason to kick someone. Otherwise, it may be seen as an abuse of power.

Here are activities to look out for before kicking someone:

* Spam messages
* Harassment
* Sharing child pornography
* Violating IP rights
* Sharing viruses
* Advocating self-harm or suicide
* Distributing gore content or animal cruelty
* Life threats to another user

If you see someone involved in these, you can kick them off your server or report them to moderators or server owners if you don't have kicking authority.

In case the moderators or owners do not act on your complaint, you can always contact the Trust and Safety team.

If you happen to be a moderator or server owner, you have the authority to kick people off your server. Here is how to do it:

1. Go to the correct channel on Discord
2. Find the user from the user list on the right side of the screen
3. Right-click on their username and then select "Kick"
4. Click on "Kick" again to confirm your decision

## Part 4: FAQs About Discord Reporting

There is no need to Google responses to "How do you report someone on Discord," we have answers to the most frequently asked questions:

### Can I Report People on Discord Anonymously?

According to a [moderator on Discord's subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/ave1x3/are%5Freports%5Fanonymous/), information regarding a reported case remains between the T&S team and the reporter. Nothing regarding the complaint is shared with the individual kicked.

### What Happens If I Report Someone on Discord?

After you report someone on Discord, the T&S team goes through the evidence to justify or negate your claims.

Usually, this process takes a long time as the team evaluates whether the problem is part of a broader pattern.

After conducting their research and deciding upon a punishment, the T&S team will contact the offender via email to inform them about their misconduct and the relevant consequences.

In minor offenses, the T&S team will reach out to the reporter and teach them how to block the user rather than take direct action.

### Can You Report Someone on Discord for Being Under 13?

Individuals under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Discord unless they have permission from a parent or guardian. However, it is not very easy to prove that the user is below a certain age.

If you know someone who is undoubtedly underage, then you can report them to the Trust & Safety team by filling out their form and adding evidence to back your claim.

Discord has completely transformed online communication, becoming the preferred platform for gamers, streamers, and reviewers alike.

As of late, it has started integrating with other gaming and streaming services, giving us the streamer mode. With streaming's growing popularity, it's essential to know what the streamer mode is all about.

If you're a gamer, Discord's streamer mode allows you to stream your gaming session to viewers by broadcasting your game to your friends, fans, and even a closed community of enthusiasts.

Many e-gaming professionals have taken up streaming, offering original and valuable content for like-minded individuals. This mode helps them streamline all their communications in one place.

If you're new to Discord’s streamer mode, you need to know what it is, how you can use it to engage with other community members, and the primary security concerns you need to be aware of.

* [Part 2: How to Report Users on Discord Mobile App?](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Kick People on Discord?](#part3)
* [Part 4: FAQs About Discord Reporting](#part4)

For gamers in the modern era, Discord is a household name. The platform has around 120 million active users monthly as of early 2021.

With so many users on the forum, it is normal to have some "bad apples" in the mix. There are trolls, miscreants, and spammers who ruin the experience for everyone else.

You can report them to Discord Trust and Safety team. They would take appropriate action against these nuisances after reviewing evidence.

Reporting helps make healthier communities and allows you to avoid conflicts and outbreaks due to suspicious activity on the platform.

Today we will look into how to report someone on Discord using desktop and mobile devices. Moreover, we will look at other ways to deal with indecent behavior, such as kicking people or banning them.

## Part 1: How to Report Users on Discord Desktop

Before you can report a person to Discord's Trust and Safety team, you will need to enable Discord's developer mode.

Enabling this mode will allow you to obtain the information necessary to file your report.

1. Login to your Discord account on PC or Mac
2. You will see a gear icon next to your username to the bottom left of your screen; click on it

![ Discord User Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

1. There will be a list of options in the sidebar; from here, click on "Appearance"
2. Next, scroll down until you find "Developer Mode" under Advanced; turn it on

![ Turn on Discord Developer Mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-discord-developer-mode.jpg)

After enabling developer mode, you will now need the user ID of the person you are reporting. To get someone's user ID:

1. Right-click on their username
2. From the list of options that appear, choose "Copy ID"
3. Paste this user ID somewhere so that you can access it later

To report a specific message, you need to get the message link as well. For this:

1. Locate the message you want to report
2. Then hover your cursor over it and click on the ellipsis sign (…) on the right side
3. Click on "Copy Message Link"
4. Paste this somewhere so that you can use it later

After collecting the necessary information, go to Discord's website to report it to [Discord's Trust and Safety Team](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket%5Fform%5Fid=360000029731).
