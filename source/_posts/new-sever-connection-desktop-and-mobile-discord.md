[Discord is a voice and text chat service](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to bring like-minded people together, especially e-sports professionals.

The goal was to provide users with an improved communications platform that could streamline the way people speak in real-time and over the internet.

Originally designed for gamers, the app allowed users to communicate with others who share interests on a given topic.

After a while, the Discord app expanded its reach and included non-gamers as well. Today, it is one of the most popular chatting apps out there.

However, if, for any reason, you want to delete or disable your account for good, you can. In the following articles, you will learn about how to delete your account step by step.

## Part 1: How To Delete A Discord Account Permanently?

Are you done with a game, scared about your data, or just bored with the app? No problem! If you want to learn how to delete your discord account, look no further.

But before doing so, you’ll have to do two quick things:

* Reassign ‘administrative rights’ of the servers
* Completely delete them

The only reason you will have to think about these things is if you assumed responsibility for any server.

Without further ado, here are some easy to follow steps to delete a Discord account permanently:

1. Open the Discord app
2. Sign in to your Discord account and open the user settings option (Cog icon)

![How to Delete Discord Account - Go to My Account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-discord-my-account.jpg)

1. Click the “My Account” option in the user setting menu. At the very bottom of the screen, you’ll see the “delete account” option

![Delete Discord Account Permantely - Account Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-delete-account-option.jpg)

1. Click the delete account button to make your Discord account disappear!

However, if you’ve activated 2FA, you may also be asked to put your password and 2FA code.

Also, if you want to delete your account permanently, there are some things you need to do before completing the process.

As mentioned before, if you’re the server’s owner, you’ll have to either delete your server or transfer its ownership to a trusted source.

For transferring ownership on Discord, follow these steps:

1. Open the Discord app
2. Click the “server name,” and a range of options will open; then click “server setting”
3. At the bottom-left of the screen, click the ‘members’ option below “User Management”
4. Here you’ll make the critical decision of who gets the keys to your kingdom. Once you decide who to transfer the ownership to, click the “3 vertical dots”
5. As the “dialog menu” opens, click “Transfer Ownership”

Once it’s completed, you’ll become a regular server member. Your access to the server will be limited and as per the set position.

On the other hand, if you don’t want to transfer its ownership to someone else, you can also delete it.

Here’s how you can delete the server to complete the process of deleting your Discord account:

1. Click the “Server Name” again
2. Within the several options, click the “Server Settings.”
3. At the bottom-left of your window, click the “Delete Server” option in the “User Management” section.

![Delete Discord Server to Delete Account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-discord-server-account.jpg)

1. Once clicked, the system will ask you to enter the account password to delete your server (or servers) from existence altogether

Like the primary Discord account deletion process, if you have enabled 2FA on this account, you’ll have to put in the code to get things completed.

After this, you’ll be asked one more time to click the “delete server” button before it is completely deleted. Keep in mind that you’ll have 14 days time to recover your Discord account. Once the two-week time passes, you won’t be able to retrieve or sign in to your account.

Once the account is deleted, the username will show up as “deleteduser 0000” or something similar to this. However, users you have texted via your account will still see your texts.

## Part 2: How to Delete Discord Account From iPhone And Android?

Yes, you can delete the discord account from iPhone and Android. And if you’re wondering how to delete a Discord account, Here’s a quick way to do it:

1. Open your updated discord app and tap the “hamburger” menu located at the top-left
2. Tap the gear icon so you can go to the “user settings.”
3. Select “My Account”
4. Below the “Account Management” option, choose “Delete Account” and put your password and 2FA (if you have set it up)

## Part 3: How To Disable Discord Account On Desktop Computer?

Deleting the account means you won’t be able to use it further, whereas disabling the account normally means you’re taking a little break.

So, if you don’t want to remove or delete your account entirely but only want it gone for some time, choose the disable option.

Here’s how you can disable a Discord account on a desktop computer:

1. Open the app on your window PC/Mac and then log in to your Discord account
2. Click the “User Settings” option and then go to the “My Account” option within the user settings
3. In the lower corner of your Mac/PC screen, you’ll see the “Disable Account” button next to the “Delete Account” button

![How to disable discord account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/disable-discord-account.jpg)

1. Click the “Disable Account” option, and it will be disabled.

#### **What’s The Difference Between Disabling And Deleting A Discord Account?**

Disabling the account means you can recover it anytime you want, unlike deleting the account where you only have a 14-day restoration window. Additionally, when the account is disabled, you won’t receive notifications, but you will still get “friend requests.”

## Part 4: How To Disable Discord Account On Mobile?

Disabling your Discord account for Android and iOS isn’t as simple as it is on a Desktop Windows/Mac PC.

Currently, there is no direct way to either delete or disable your Discord account through a mobile device.

2. Tap the cog icon on the lower right corner of the phone
3. Tap on the “My Account” option in the “User Settings” menu

## FAQs About Deleting Discord Account

#### 1\. How Long Does Discord Take To Delete Account?

Typically, once you have completed the entire deletion process, Discord takes approximately 14 to 30 days to process it.

#### 2\. What Happens When You Delete Discord Account?

Deleting your discord account won’t delete the information you have on the account. It will delete your profile and rename the account to “deleteduser.” However, all your data and messages will remain on the server or servers.

#### 3\. Can I Re-Use The Deleted Discord Account?

You can re-use your deleted discord account only if the account is in a “pending deletion state,” which is 14 days. If the time is passed, you won’t be able to re-use it.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Like TeamSpeak or Skype, Discord is a chat app aimed at easy mass communication. Although it was made for gamers, it is readily used for communicating in offices, during projects, or for professional collaboration.

Even though it's straightforward to use, there are several Discord features that you may be unfamiliar with.

One such feature is called pinning messages. It is available to moderators, administrators, server owners, and other users who have permission to "Manage Messages" in various server channels.

This feature helps you find and share vital messages quickly, especially when new users join a specific channel.

It acts like a sticky note for Discord, making sure valuable information such as server rules do not get overshadowed by new messages even months after the pinned messages are first posted.

Today, we will go over how to pin a message on Discord for your desktop app on PC and Mac, as well as on your iPhone and Android mobile devices.

## Part 1: How to Pin A Message on Discord Desktop?

If you want to learn how to pin messages on Discord desktop, follow these steps:

1. Hover over any message which you wish to pin.
2. On the right-hand side of it, there will be a button that would read as More; click it and you will see a screen like below

![ Pin message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pin-messages-on-discord.jpg)

1. Now, click on the "Pin Message" option
2. After which, you will be presented with a prompt asking you to confirm that you want to pin this particular message. Click on "Oh yeah, pin it."

![ Pin message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/double-check-pin-messages.jpg)

That's it! You have now learned how to pin messages on Discord for the desktop application.

But make sure you don't pin everything that might seem important at a glance — only pin messages that may have utility in the future.

Also, don't pin messages that are just important for you. In larger channels, prioritize pinning messages that will benefit most participants.

## Part 2: How to Pin Messages on Discord Mobile App?

Pinning messages in the mobile app is very similar to how it is done on the desktop application. Do it by:

1. Just hold down your finger on the message you wish to pin
2. A couple of seconds later, you will be presented with a list of options
3. From here, click on "Pin Message"

![ Pin message on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pin-message-on-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. A pop-up will appear confirming if you want to pin the message. If you are sure you want to pin a particular message, tap the "Yes" button and then your message is pinned

## Part 3: How to View Pinned Messages on Discord

Accessing pinned messages is just as easy as pinning them. To access a pinned message on the app's desktop version:

1. Click on the pin icon appearing on the top right-hand side of your screen

![view Pinned message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-pinned-message.jpg)

1. Doing this will present you with a drop-down list of pinned messages. Now, you can tap on the "Jump" button next to the "x" (cross) icon to go directly to the pinned message
2. This will allow you to understand the context behind the pinned message. You can also access and share links in the pinned messages from here

## Part 4: How to View Pinned Messages on Discord Mobile

View your pins on the mobile version of Discord by:

1. Swiping from right to left, which will open up a side menu
2. Then click on "Pins," which is the second option from the left, as shown in the picture below

![view Pinned message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-pinned-message-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Now you will be in the pinned messages window
2. You can jump to a specific pinned message by clicking on it, allowing you to access any content or links in the message

## Part 5: Limit on Pinned Messages

You can only pin 50 messages in the pin box in Discord, meaning if you want to pin new messages, you will have to delete older ones to make space.

This may feel like a disadvantage. However, it makes perfect sense. Pinning messages is only for important information that must be used in the future.

Removing this limit and giving people free rein on the number of messages they can pin will eventually lead to too many pinned messages, defeating the feature's purpose.

## Part 6: How to Delete Pinned Messages on Discord?

If something pinned in the past has become redundant over time, you can remove it from the pinned messages.

This will make sure your pinned messages do not stockpile over time, and there is space to add new messages important to the server.

To remove pinned messages on desktops:

1. Go to the pin icon used to access pins
2. Next, hover over the message you wish to unpin and click on the "x" (cross) button next to the jump button
3. After this, click on the "yeah, remove it please kthx" button
4. The message will now stop appearing in the list of pinned messages

To do the same for mobile devices:

1. Swipe right to left to access the side menu
2. Click on "Pins" to view all the messages pinned by you or other people on the server with permissions to pin
3. Then hold down on the message, which will give you an option to unpin it
4. Click on "Unpin" to remove the message from the list of pinned messages

**Things to keep in mind**:

* You can skip the pop-up shown above when trying to remove a pinned message. All you must do is hold shift when clicking on the "x" (cross) button allowing you to go on that spree of unpins
* Another thing to remember is that all these tips on how pin messages apply to both Direct Messages (DM) and Server group chats

#### All in All

Learning how to pin a message on Discord could be a little tricky at first, mostly if you haven't done so in the past and someone spontaneously asks you to do so.

However, the feature is pretty intuitive and straightforward once you get the hang of it.

The usefulness of pinning makes it very important for both old and new users as you can relay important information without having to go through tons of old messages.
