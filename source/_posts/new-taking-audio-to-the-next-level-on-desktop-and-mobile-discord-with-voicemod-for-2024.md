## Part 1: How To Use Voice Changer Voicemod For Discord On Desktop Computer

Voicemod is arguably one of the best voice changer tools available on the internet for its excellent features.

But before we jump straight into using Voicemod for Discord, you must know how to install one on your desktop Mac/PC.

### Here's how to install Voicemod

1. Visit the Voicemod website to begin the download process.
2. You'll see the button “Get Voicemod Free” on the screen. Click it!
3. Upon clicking, the site will ask you to sign in to your account from Discord, Twitch, to Google. Use your Discord login details to sign in.
4. After you're signed in, the “.exe” file will be downloaded to your PC/Mac's download folder. Open the “.exe” file the moment it's downloaded.
5. An install wizard will open up. Navigate through the wizard's installation process to install the program on your PC/Mac.
6. After installation is complete, the installation wizard will ask to restart your windows' Mac or PC.

You can skip it, but it's best to restart it for smooth operations.

Once your Mac/PC restarts, you'll see the Voicemod app icon on your desktop screen.

Now that you have successfully installed the voice changer Voicemod app into your desktop computer, let's dive into knowing **how to use Voicemod on Discord**!

### Here's how to use voice changer on Discord

1. Click the Vociemod icon on the desktop to open the app. If you can't find it there, click the “windows icon” located at the screen's bottom-left. Just type “Voicemod,” and the program will show up. Double click it to get it opened.
2. When the app opens up, you'll have to choose the output and input it will use. If you're wondering, why the output? This is to give you an insight into what your voice will sound like on each filter.

Once it's done, you can play around with different filters!

Every day, you'll get new free filters to use; however, to unlock and access all filters, you need to upgrade to the “pro-version” of voice changer Voicemod.

On the other hand, if you only need a few filters, the “basic-version” should suffice.

Apart from that, you can unlock an additional free filter in your app by sharing it on your social media accounts.

![Set up Voicemod for Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-voicemod-discord.jpg)

#### Step 1

To set up Voicemod with Discord, open your discord account and go to the settings (gear icon) placed at the screen's bottom-left corner.

#### Step 2

Click the “Voice and Video” option right under the app settings.

#### Step 3

To make Voicemod usable, you'll have to change Voice settings. Within the “Input Device” option, select the option that says “Microphone Voicemod Virtual Audio.”

#### Step 4

After you have changed settings, you can easily change the voice within the program. Not only this, but other users can also hear your audio alteration.

#### Step 5

With the “basic version,” you'll have seven free voice choices that will change each day. On the contrary, with the “pro-version,” you'll gain access to more than 80 different voice options.

So, if you're searching for an easy and simple voice-changing app to use, look no further than Voicemod!

## Part 2: How To Fix Voicemod Not Working Discord?

Is your voice changer Voicemod not working on Discord? No worries, you can troubleshoot the issues with a few basic steps.

Here are some ways you can use to fix Voicemod not working in Discord:

### Method 1: Restart Your Windows PC/Mac

Though it's not a technical solution, restarting your desktop computer fixes incorrect settings by rebooting them and solves many problems connected with your computer system, programs, and hardware.

So, when your Voicemod suddenly ceases to work in Discord, make sure to restart your Windows PC/Mac before going any further, as it's the first step in fixing voice issues.

If restarting doesn't help, slide to the next step!

### Method 2: Make Sure The Mic Is Properly Set

The next step is to check if the mic works correctly. This is because faulty settings may stop voice changer Voicemod from operating correctly.

Just follow the steps below to resolve it:

1. On the keyboard, press the “Win” logo and the “I” key simultaneously to open Windows settings. Click “System.”
2. On the left, you'll see the option “Sound.” Click it.

![Set up Windows Sound for Voicemod](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-windows-sound.jpg)

1. First, you have to test the microphone! To do so, choose the “Headset” option rather than the Voicemod microphone under the “Input” section
2. Click “Device properties & test microphone”
3. Make sure to uncheck the “disable” box and keep the volume section 100
4. Click the “Start test” button and speak into the microphone
5. After that, click “Stop test.” If the greatest value it shows is above “0”, then your microphone works correctly

Now, restart your Voicemod app to see if it's working properly or not! If the issue still persists, jump to the next solution.

### Method 3: Install Windows Updates

If you use Windows 10, it has two kinds of updates that offer performance boost and security patches. Sometimes, an update can fix a few driver and software conflicts automatically.

1. Open your windows setting by pressing the “Windows button” and the “I” key together.
2. Click on “Update and Security”
3. Click the “Check for Updates” button. If an update is found, it will install automatically on the system

Make sure to repeat this process until it says you're up-to-date. Then, restart the PC. Check whether the Vociemod is properly working or not!

If not, try our next option!

### Method 4:Re-Install Voice Changer Voicemod Drivers

In many instances, the issue signifies that you're using outdated or faulty drivers. To troubleshoot this, simply re-install your Voicemod driver, and you'll be good to go!

First, uninstall your Voicemod driver from the windows PC/Mac. Here's how to do it:

3. Click the “expand” option of “Audio Inputs & Outputs.”
4. Click the “Microphone WMD” and choose the “Uninstall device” option

## Part 1: How To Use Voice Changer Voicemod For Discord On Desktop Computer

Voicemod is arguably one of the best voice changer tools available on the internet for its excellent features.

But before we jump straight into using Voicemod for Discord, you must know how to install one on your desktop Mac/PC.

### Here's how to install Voicemod

1. Visit the Voicemod website to begin the download process.
2. You'll see the button “Get Voicemod Free” on the screen. Click it!
3. Upon clicking, the site will ask you to sign in to your account from Discord, Twitch, to Google. Use your Discord login details to sign in.
4. After you're signed in, the “.exe” file will be downloaded to your PC/Mac's download folder. Open the “.exe” file the moment it's downloaded.
5. An install wizard will open up. Navigate through the wizard's installation process to install the program on your PC/Mac.
6. After installation is complete, the installation wizard will ask to restart your windows' Mac or PC.

You can skip it, but it's best to restart it for smooth operations.

Once your Mac/PC restarts, you'll see the Voicemod app icon on your desktop screen.

Now that you have successfully installed the voice changer Voicemod app into your desktop computer, let's dive into knowing **how to use Voicemod on Discord**!

### Here's how to use voice changer on Discord

1. Click the Vociemod icon on the desktop to open the app. If you can't find it there, click the “windows icon” located at the screen's bottom-left. Just type “Voicemod,” and the program will show up. Double click it to get it opened.
2. When the app opens up, you'll have to choose the output and input it will use. If you're wondering, why the output? This is to give you an insight into what your voice will sound like on each filter.

Once it's done, you can play around with different filters!

Every day, you'll get new free filters to use; however, to unlock and access all filters, you need to upgrade to the “pro-version” of voice changer Voicemod.

On the other hand, if you only need a few filters, the “basic-version” should suffice.

Apart from that, you can unlock an additional free filter in your app by sharing it on your social media accounts.

#### Step 2

Click the “Voice and Video” option right under the app settings.

#### Step 3

To make Voicemod usable, you'll have to change Voice settings. Within the “Input Device” option, select the option that says “Microphone Voicemod Virtual Audio.”

#### Step 4

After you have changed settings, you can easily change the voice within the program. Not only this, but other users can also hear your audio alteration.

#### Step 5

With the “basic version,” you'll have seven free voice choices that will change each day. On the contrary, with the “pro-version,” you'll gain access to more than 80 different voice options.
