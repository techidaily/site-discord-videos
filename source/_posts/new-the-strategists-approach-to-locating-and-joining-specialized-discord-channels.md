## How to Find Discord Server

Discord started out as a place for Gamers to hang out and play together online. Soon, it became a popular chat forum for people who obsess over music, movies, art, and anime fans.

Initially, Discord served as a voice channel for Gamers. However, today it is much more than that. It has bots, streaming features, voice channels, and many more personalization tools that make your server an intimate Hangout.

Using Discord without joining a server is as good as not using Discord at all. But if you are a newbie, you might find it difficult to join a server with active users. Not all servers are good, and this guide will help you filter out the best servers on Discord.

If you keep scrolling, you will come across popular channels or channels that have witnessed a sudden spike. On the disboard site, you can also read reviews about servers before joining them. You can also sort the servers according to your location.

1. [Discordservers.com](http://discordservers.com/)

![Find Discord Server via  Discordservers.com](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-discord-server-via-discordservers-bot.jpg)

This directory houses a vast collection of servers that are dedicated gaming community and geekdom. Upon entering the site, you will immediately notice that it has a sleek and minimal interface.

## Part 3: How to Find Private Discord Server

Along with Public Servers that can be joined just with a click, there are many private servers. These servers can be entered only by invitation. The server's creator can send the invitations to you, or you will find the links on Twitter, Facebook, or other platforms.

The obvious questions that you will encounter after signing up on Discord are - **How to find Discord server**? Is it difficult? Do I have to fill up an application?

Unlike public servers, private servers have 50 to 500 members. They are not as active as the open ones, but they might be more dedicated to a specific community. Open servers are often more active, but they are "general." In case you want a more personal space with a few people, you might consider joining a private server.

Looking for a private server is a lot easier on platforms like Reddit. Here, you may find a link that leads to a private server. When you click on it, you will be directed to a landing page. Once you tap on the 'Accept Invite,' you will get into the private server.

Some servers require you to follow certain guidelines. If you don't comply, you will get a warning message from the mod or the bot. In worse scenarios, you might be kicked out. Further, some channels will prompt you to text the mod before you are allowed to enter. This is **how to find a** **Discord server that is private**.

Further, you can create your own server and invite your friends or your gaming clan to it. A server can be a personal space where you can talk to your friends via voice channels, stream games together, chat, share memes, listen to music, and add bots!

## Part 4: Find Discord Servers to Join Via other Platforms

Like we discussed above, Reddit is one of the places to find private Discord servers. Similarly, pages and communities on Facebook, Twitch, YouTube, and others might also link out to their Discord servers.

Further, influencers, series, movies may have a dedicated Discord server. Even blogs and websites can have a channel for their followers. Several gaming companies have a Discord channel for sharing tips with fans and for updates.

Several game streamers that stream on Twitch or Mixer have their own server where they update their followers. If you follow them, you can join their channel. The same goes for YouTubers and other gamers. Even tech-geek blogs and vlogs have a Discord server.

At the same time, people interested in business, the stock market, and investment have channels of their own. You can even find servers made by some musicians, artists, manga fans, anime fans, and more such communities.

Whenever you visit your favorite site, blog, or YouTube channel the next time, look if they have a Discord channel!
