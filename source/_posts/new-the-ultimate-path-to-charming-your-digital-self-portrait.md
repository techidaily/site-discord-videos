A part of the appeal of the popular multimedia messaging platform Discord is that users can assume online identities that present them in a favorable light. Since Discord serves to enable groups of friends or people with shared interests to communicate in real-time, standing out from the crowd and establishing a well-known and well-liked persona can be very challenging. Every element of presence on the platform contributes to the overall impression the user will make, and his profile picture is definitely one of the most impactful elements that go a long way towards identity building.

_**It’s important to note that Discord users can only use a single profile picture or avatar on the platform, and can’t switch them from one server to another.**_ This rule serves to establish some accountability and familiarity and applies even to server administrators. With that in mind, choosing a great image to represent you everywhere on the Discord platform is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly. To help you do this the right way while respecting all the rules, we prepared a detailed guide for this process.

## Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance

Like all other social networks and online communication services, Discord has a set of rules determining whether a certain image is suitable for use as an avatar.

First of all, you have to adhere to a size limit for technical reasons, as too large images would slow down the channel. On the other hand, too small images won’t be legible and can look bad due to pixelization. The most optimal image size you should use for your Discord profile photo is at least **512 x 512 pixels** – enough to be clearly visible and far above the **180 x 180-pixel minimum**.

You don’t have to use your real photo or likeness for your Discord avatar – in fact, you don’t have to use a realistic image at all. Discord allows the use of photographs as well as various types of illustrations and cartoon images and accepts JPG as well as the animated GIF format.

This gives you a lot of freedom to craft your new identity and uses some powerful imagery, either created from scratch or taken from the internet. However, there are still some community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your submission for a profile picture might be rejected for failing to meet Discord’s T&C.

Basically, no NSFW images are allowed on Discord so you will have to avoid anything extreme or controversial. Pornographic content or explicit nudity is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions or promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality. You also need to stay away from violent imagery or anything depicting illegal activity, including drug use, racial discrimination, or mistreatment of animals. While this eliminates a lot of content, it still leaves enough room to express yourself freely without risking offending any other Discord users.

## Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download

If you want to download a cool Discord profile picture, you can check the following websites:

#### 1\. discordavatars.com

This website collects free Discord avatars and profile pictures, which allow you to download without any limitations. You can search for a Discord avatar on the search bar or find it from the popular tags on the side.

![download filmora PFP from discordavatar.com](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discordavatars-profile-picture-download.jpg)

 Besides Discord PFP downloading, you can also find some resources and tips about Discord on this website.

#### 2\. Discord Profile Pictures and Server Icons from woodpunchsgraphics.com

This website provides both regular non-animated and animated profile pictures for Discord, but as you may all know, you can only add an animated profile when you subscribed to Discord Nitro.

![Discord Profile Pictures and Server Icons templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-profile-pictures-server-icons-template-customize.jpg)

There are limited Discord profile picture and server icon templates on this website, and you should customize the color and text, and submit your email to purchase.

## Part 3: How to Create A Discord Avatar in Filmora?

Many Discord users ultimately decide to create custom profile pictures using external visual tools, and this option is highly recommended to anyone with at least basic creative skills. It doesn’t take too much effort to make a fantastic avatar that will be completely unique and tell exactly the story you want. There are many different software tools you can use for this purpose, but since the task is very simple you can use a practical, free program such as Filmora.

The procedure of creating a profile picture for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complex and involves just a few simple steps.

You should start by identifying the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be an animated character or a real-life photo. You can search on Google image or download it from some discord profile sites.

Next, you need to load the selected image into a new project, and then resize the image to fit the preferred dimensions for Discord and change its shape to circular. To change the shape, go to Effects -> Utility -> Image Mask to optimize the image for a Discord avatar.

![create discord avatar with Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-overlay-image-mask-discord-profile-wondershare-filmora.jpg)

By adding overlays on top of the basic image, you can also introduce any visual or textual elements that will personalize the avatar even further. To get maximum attention, you might want to use a video or animation as part of the avatar – just add them to overlays and save your file as GIF. Since Discord allows GIF format, you can get an avatar that literally jumps off the page in every chat that you are a part of and elicits a strong reaction from those who see it.

## Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?

After you successfully created a profile image that you are completely satisfied with, it’s time to upload it to Discord and start using it as your avatar in all your chats. However, this is not done in the same way on different platforms, so you will need to follow the instructions for the type of system you normally use to access your Discord account.

### How to Change Avatars on Discord Desktop Computer?

Open your Discord app (Mac or Windows version) and look for a gear icon in the bottom left corner of your screen. Clicking on this icon will take you to the User settings menu, where you need to find the My Account tab.

Next, hover with your mouse cursor over the current profile picture, then click on the icon that appears right next to it. This action will let you upload an image (JPG or GIF) from your hard drive and make it your new profile picture.

![change discord avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-discord-profile-avatar.jpg)

Keep in mind that Discord will automatically crop images that are not already in a circular format, so you need to make sure that the image is well centered before uploading.

### How to Change Discord Avatars on Mobile Devices?

The procedure for changing the profile avatar on Discord from a mobile device is equally straightforward, and it’s similar on both Android and iOS phones. After you open the app, you need to tap on the icon in the right bottom corner to access the Account menu.

Find the profile picture in the screen that opens, and tap on it to access your phone gallery, then choose the image you would like to use for identification on Discord. It will automatically be uploaded and replace the current image as your only avatar on all Discord channels until it’s changed again.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Profile Pictures on Discord

#### 1\. Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?

If you experience this problem, it’s most likely a consequence of trying to make too many picture changes too fast. While Discord will allow you to upload two profile images in rapid succession, the third attempt within a few minutes is going to be unsuccessful. The problem will disappear if you wait for a short period of time and try uploading again. Another reason might be that your firewall is preventing you from using an image from a cloud server, but you can easily bypass the issue and download the picture first to your hard disc before uploading it to Discord from there.

#### 2\. How can I find my old profile picture?

All of the images you previously used as Discord avatars remain memorized and can be reactivated at any time. You can find this collection of images on a specific portion of your profile page, so if you want to use any of them you can simply click on them without having to go through the regular upload process all over again.

#### 3\. What do the colored dots next to my profile picture mean?

Those dots indicate the current status of the user, with each color having a fixed meaning. If you see a green dot, the user is available to chat at the moment. A yellow dot indicated an idle user that hasn’t been active in a while, and the red color means the user is busy and doesn’t want to be disturbed. Finally, a gray dot confirms that the user is currently not signed in to his Discord account.

#### 4\. Can I use different avatars on different Discord servers?

Unfortunately, this is not possible to do. While Discord lets you use multiple nicknames on different servers, every member (including admins) can have just one avatar on Discord at any given time.

#### 5\. How can I download someone’s profile icon in Discord?

If you like someone’s photo and want to save it, you will need to open that member’s profile by clicking on it and choosing View Profile. Next, you need to activate the Inspect element window and copy the image URL from here. Pasting the URL into your browser will open the image and allow you to save it as you would do with any other picture from the internet.

## Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance

Like all other social networks and online communication services, Discord has a set of rules determining whether a certain image is suitable for use as an avatar.

First of all, you have to adhere to a size limit for technical reasons, as too large images would slow down the channel. On the other hand, too small images won’t be legible and can look bad due to pixelization. The most optimal image size you should use for your Discord profile photo is at least **512 x 512 pixels** – enough to be clearly visible and far above the **180 x 180-pixel minimum**.

You don’t have to use your real photo or likeness for your Discord avatar – in fact, you don’t have to use a realistic image at all. Discord allows the use of photographs as well as various types of illustrations and cartoon images and accepts JPG as well as the animated GIF format.

This gives you a lot of freedom to craft your new identity and uses some powerful imagery, either created from scratch or taken from the internet. However, there are still some community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your submission for a profile picture might be rejected for failing to meet Discord’s T&C.

Basically, no NSFW images are allowed on Discord so you will have to avoid anything extreme or controversial. Pornographic content or explicit nudity is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions or promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality. You also need to stay away from violent imagery or anything depicting illegal activity, including drug use, racial discrimination, or mistreatment of animals. While this eliminates a lot of content, it still leaves enough room to express yourself freely without risking offending any other Discord users.

## Part 2: Discord Profile Pictures Download

If you want to download a cool Discord profile picture, you can check the following websites:

#### 1\. discordavatars.com

This website collects free Discord avatars and profile pictures, which allow you to download without any limitations. You can search for a Discord avatar on the search bar or find it from the popular tags on the side.

![download filmora PFP from discordavatar.com](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discordavatars-profile-picture-download.jpg)

 Besides Discord PFP downloading, you can also find some resources and tips about Discord on this website.

#### 2\. Discord Profile Pictures and Server Icons from woodpunchsgraphics.com

This website provides both regular non-animated and animated profile pictures for Discord, but as you may all know, you can only add an animated profile when you subscribed to Discord Nitro.

![Discord Profile Pictures and Server Icons templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-profile-pictures-server-icons-template-customize.jpg)

There are limited Discord profile picture and server icon templates on this website, and you should customize the color and text, and submit your email to purchase.

## Part 3: How to Create A Discord Avatar in Filmora?

Many Discord users ultimately decide to create custom profile pictures using external visual tools, and this option is highly recommended to anyone with at least basic creative skills. It doesn’t take too much effort to make a fantastic avatar that will be completely unique and tell exactly the story you want. There are many different software tools you can use for this purpose, but since the task is very simple you can use a practical, free program such as Filmora.

The procedure of creating a profile picture for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complex and involves just a few simple steps.

You should start by identifying the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be an animated character or a real-life photo. You can search on Google image or download it from some discord profile sites.

Next, you need to load the selected image into a new project, and then resize the image to fit the preferred dimensions for Discord and change its shape to circular. To change the shape, go to Effects -> Utility -> Image Mask to optimize the image for a Discord avatar.

![create discord avatar with Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-overlay-image-mask-discord-profile-wondershare-filmora.jpg)

By adding overlays on top of the basic image, you can also introduce any visual or textual elements that will personalize the avatar even further. To get maximum attention, you might want to use a video or animation as part of the avatar – just add them to overlays and save your file as GIF. Since Discord allows GIF format, you can get an avatar that literally jumps off the page in every chat that you are a part of and elicits a strong reaction from those who see it.

## Part 4: How to Change My Profile Picture on Discord?

After you successfully created a profile image that you are completely satisfied with, it’s time to upload it to Discord and start using it as your avatar in all your chats. However, this is not done in the same way on different platforms, so you will need to follow the instructions for the type of system you normally use to access your Discord account.

### How to Change Avatars on Discord Desktop Computer?

Open your Discord app (Mac or Windows version) and look for a gear icon in the bottom left corner of your screen. Clicking on this icon will take you to the User settings menu, where you need to find the My Account tab.

Next, hover with your mouse cursor over the current profile picture, then click on the icon that appears right next to it. This action will let you upload an image (JPG or GIF) from your hard drive and make it your new profile picture.

![change discord avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-discord-profile-avatar.jpg)

Keep in mind that Discord will automatically crop images that are not already in a circular format, so you need to make sure that the image is well centered before uploading.

### How to Change Discord Avatars on Mobile Devices?

The procedure for changing the profile avatar on Discord from a mobile device is equally straightforward, and it’s similar on both Android and iOS phones. After you open the app, you need to tap on the icon in the right bottom corner to access the Account menu.

Find the profile picture in the screen that opens, and tap on it to access your phone gallery, then choose the image you would like to use for identification on Discord. It will automatically be uploaded and replace the current image as your only avatar on all Discord channels until it’s changed again.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Profile Pictures on Discord

#### 1\. Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?

If you experience this problem, it’s most likely a consequence of trying to make too many picture changes too fast. While Discord will allow you to upload two profile images in rapid succession, the third attempt within a few minutes is going to be unsuccessful. The problem will disappear if you wait for a short period of time and try uploading again. Another reason might be that your firewall is preventing you from using an image from a cloud server, but you can easily bypass the issue and download the picture first to your hard disc before uploading it to Discord from there.

#### 2\. How can I find my old profile picture?

All of the images you previously used as Discord avatars remain memorized and can be reactivated at any time. You can find this collection of images on a specific portion of your profile page, so if you want to use any of them you can simply click on them without having to go through the regular upload process all over again.

#### 3\. What do the colored dots next to my profile picture mean?

Those dots indicate the current status of the user, with each color having a fixed meaning. If you see a green dot, the user is available to chat at the moment. A yellow dot indicated an idle user that hasn’t been active in a while, and the red color means the user is busy and doesn’t want to be disturbed. Finally, a gray dot confirms that the user is currently not signed in to his Discord account.

#### 4\. Can I use different avatars on different Discord servers?

Unfortunately, this is not possible to do. While Discord lets you use multiple nicknames on different servers, every member (including admins) can have just one avatar on Discord at any given time.

#### 5\. How can I download someone’s profile icon in Discord?

If you like someone’s photo and want to save it, you will need to open that member’s profile by clicking on it and choosing View Profile. Next, you need to activate the Inspect element window and copy the image URL from here. Pasting the URL into your browser will open the image and allow you to save it as you would do with any other picture from the internet.

Discord is packed with great features, but one thing it’s missing is a screen recorder. You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.

Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.

One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.

## Part 1: Best Windows/Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord

If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust [screen recording tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.

### 1. OBS

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.

There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.

### 2. Bandicam

Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.

Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn't involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95\. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.

### 3. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features [screen recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 4. DemoCreator

If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider [Wondershare DemoCreator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/). Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.

You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.

### 5. Camtasia

If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.

However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.

## Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord

If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.

### 2. Screen Capture

One such option is [Screen Capture](https://www.screencapture.com/), which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.

There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

### 3. Clipchamp

If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/). Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.

It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.

### 3. Screencast-o-matic

The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is [Screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder). This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.

The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.

## Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android

If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.

### 1. AZ Screen Recorder

[AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US) is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.

It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.

### 2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots

Another option for Android is [‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US). Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.

The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.

### 3. Record It

If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘[Record It!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545)’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.

The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.

## Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?

If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.

Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.

You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.

If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.

Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.

The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.

Discord is packed with great features, but one thing it’s missing is a screen recorder. You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.

Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.

One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.

* [Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?](#part4)

## Part 1: Best Windows/Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord

If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust [screen recording tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.

### 1. OBS

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.

There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.

### 2. Bandicam

Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.

Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn't involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95\. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.

### 3. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features [screen recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 4. DemoCreator

If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider [Wondershare DemoCreator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/). Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.

You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.

### 5. Camtasia

If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.

However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.

## Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord

If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.

### 2. Screen Capture

One such option is [Screen Capture](https://www.screencapture.com/), which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.

There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

### 3. Clipchamp

If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/). Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.

It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.

### 3. Screencast-o-matic

The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is [Screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder). This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.

The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.

## Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android

If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.

### 1. AZ Screen Recorder

[AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US) is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.

It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.

### 2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots

Another option for Android is [‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US). Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.

The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.

### 3. Record It

If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘[Record It!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545)’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.

The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.

## Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?

If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.

Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.

You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.

If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.

Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.

The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.
