Discord is packed with great features, but one thing it’s missing is a screen recorder. You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.

Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.

One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.

* [Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?](#part4)

## Part 1: Best Windows/Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord

If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust [screen recording tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.

### 1. OBS

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.

There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.

### 2. Bandicam

Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.

Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn't involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95\. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.

### 3. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features [screen recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 4. DemoCreator

If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider [Wondershare DemoCreator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/). Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.

You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.

### 5. Camtasia

If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.

However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.

## Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord

If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.

### 2. Screen Capture

One such option is [Screen Capture](https://www.screencapture.com/), which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.

There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

### 3. Clipchamp

If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/). Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.

It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.

### 3. Screencast-o-matic

The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is [Screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder). This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.

The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.

## Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android

If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.

### 1. AZ Screen Recorder

[AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US) is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.

It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.

### 2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots

Another option for Android is [‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US). Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.

The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.

### 3. Record It

If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘[Record It!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545)’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.

The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.

## Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?

If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.

Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.

You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.

If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.

Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.

The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.

[AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US) is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.

It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.

### 2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots

Another option for Android is [‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US). Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.

The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.

### 3. Record It

If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘[Record It!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545)’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.

The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.

## Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?

If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.

Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.

You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.

If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.

Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.

The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.

Discord is packed with great features, but one thing it’s missing is a screen recorder. You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.

Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.

One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.

* [Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?](#part4)

## Part 1: Best Windows/Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord

If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust [screen recording tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.

### 1. OBS

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.

There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.

### 2. Bandicam

Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.

Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn't involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95\. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.

### 3. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features [screen recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 4. DemoCreator

If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider [Wondershare DemoCreator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/). Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.

You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.

### 5. Camtasia

If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.

However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.

## Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord

If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.

### 2. Screen Capture

One such option is [Screen Capture](https://www.screencapture.com/), which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.

There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

### 3. Clipchamp

If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/). Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.

It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.

### 3. Screencast-o-matic

The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is [Screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder). This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.

The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.

## Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android

If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.

### 1. AZ Screen Recorder

[AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US) is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device.

## Mastering Discord: A Guide to Filing Reports Against Misconduct

# How to Report Someone on Discord

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord has completely transformed online communication, becoming the preferred platform for gamers, streamers, and reviewers alike.

As of late, it has started integrating with other gaming and streaming services, giving us the streamer mode. With streaming's growing popularity, it's essential to know what the streamer mode is all about.

If you're a gamer, Discord's streamer mode allows you to stream your gaming session to viewers by broadcasting your game to your friends, fans, and even a closed community of enthusiasts.

Many e-gaming professionals have taken up streaming, offering original and valuable content for like-minded individuals. This mode helps them streamline all their communications in one place.

If you're new to Discord’s streamer mode, you need to know what it is, how you can use it to engage with other community members, and the primary security concerns you need to be aware of.

* [Part 2: How to Report Users on Discord Mobile App?](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Kick People on Discord?](#part3)
* [Part 4: FAQs About Discord Reporting](#part4)

For gamers in the modern era, Discord is a household name. The platform has around 120 million active users monthly as of early 2021.

With so many users on the forum, it is normal to have some "bad apples" in the mix. There are trolls, miscreants, and spammers who ruin the experience for everyone else.

You can report them to Discord Trust and Safety team. They would take appropriate action against these nuisances after reviewing evidence.

Reporting helps make healthier communities and allows you to avoid conflicts and outbreaks due to suspicious activity on the platform.

Today we will look into how to report someone on Discord using desktop and mobile devices. Moreover, we will look at other ways to deal with indecent behavior, such as kicking people or banning them.

## Part 1: How to Report Users on Discord Desktop

Before you can report a person to Discord's Trust and Safety team, you will need to enable Discord's developer mode.

Enabling this mode will allow you to obtain the information necessary to file your report.

1. Login to your Discord account on PC or Mac
2. You will see a gear icon next to your username to the bottom left of your screen; click on it

![ Discord User Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

1. There will be a list of options in the sidebar; from here, click on "Appearance"
2. Next, scroll down until you find "Developer Mode" under Advanced; turn it on

![ Turn on Discord Developer Mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-discord-developer-mode.jpg)

After enabling developer mode, you will now need the user ID of the person you are reporting. To get someone's user ID:

1. Right-click on their username
2. From the list of options that appear, choose "Copy ID"
3. Paste this user ID somewhere so that you can access it later

To report a specific message, you need to get the message link as well. For this:

1. Locate the message you want to report
2. Then hover your cursor over it and click on the ellipsis sign (…) on the right side
3. Click on "Copy Message Link"
4. Paste this somewhere so that you can use it later

After collecting the necessary information, go to Discord's website to report it to [Discord's Trust and Safety Team](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket%5Fform%5Fid=360000029731).

You will have to provide your email address and post the two links copied earlier into the description box.

Also, it would help if you gave context regarding your report describing how and what rule was broken. You can also provide any other evidence you may want to present by attaching files in the attachments area.

![ Submit report request on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/submit-discord-user-report-request.jpg)

Now, confirm that you are a human by completing the captcha and then click on "Submit." Discord will contact you via email if action is taken against your complaint.

## Part 2: How to Report Users on Discord on iPhone And Android

Just like on a desktop, you will first need to enable developer mode.

1. After opening Discord on your mobile device, go to user settings by tapping on the gear icon or your profile picture next to your username
2. On iPhone, tap on "Appearance" and then go to "Advanced," whereas on Android, go to "App Settings" and tap "Behavior"

![  report people on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/report-user-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Turn on developer mode by clicking on the slider under the "Chat Behavior" option

Like before, you will now need to obtain the User ID; the process may be slightly different depending on the phone you are using. In general, the steps would be:

1. Open the user's profile by tapping on it
2. Tap on the ellipsis sign (…) in the upper-right of your screen and select "Copy ID"
3. After doing this, paste the ID somewhere you can later access

Follow the steps below to get the message link to report.

1. Go to the message and then hold down on it until a list of options appears
2. On an iPhone, tap on "Copy Message Link." For an android device, click on "Select" and then "Copy To Clipboard"

Now, you can send this information to the [Trust and Safety team](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket%5Fform%5Fid=360000029731) to assess it. To do this:

1. Paste the two links copied earlier in the "Description Box"
2. Provide your email address along with the context behind the situation
3. Click on "Submit"

## Part 3: How to Kick People on Discord

Discord also allows you to take care of improper behavior yourself. If you are a moderator or server owner, you can kick people for violating Discord's guidelines.

However, it is essential to have a reason to kick someone. Otherwise, it may be seen as an abuse of power.

Here are activities to look out for before kicking someone:

* Spam messages
* Harassment
* Sharing child pornography
* Violating IP rights
* Sharing viruses
* Advocating self-harm or suicide
* Distributing gore content or animal cruelty
* Life threats to another user

If you see someone involved in these, you can kick them off your server or report them to moderators or server owners if you don't have kicking authority.

In case the moderators or owners do not act on your complaint, you can always contact the Trust and Safety team.

If you happen to be a moderator or server owner, you have the authority to kick people off your server. Here is how to do it:

1. Go to the correct channel on Discord
2. Find the user from the user list on the right side of the screen
3. Right-click on their username and then select "Kick"
4. Click on "Kick" again to confirm your decision

## Part 4: FAQs About Discord Reporting

There is no need to Google responses to "How do you report someone on Discord," we have answers to the most frequently asked questions:

### Can I Report People on Discord Anonymously?

According to a [moderator on Discord's subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/ave1x3/are%5Freports%5Fanonymous/), information regarding a reported case remains between the T&S team and the reporter. Nothing regarding the complaint is shared with the individual kicked.

### What Happens If I Report Someone on Discord?

After you report someone on Discord, the T&S team goes through the evidence to justify or negate your claims.

Usually, this process takes a long time as the team evaluates whether the problem is part of a broader pattern.

After conducting their research and deciding upon a punishment, the T&S team will contact the offender via email to inform them about their misconduct and the relevant consequences.

In minor offenses, the T&S team will reach out to the reporter and teach them how to block the user rather than take direct action.

### Can You Report Someone on Discord for Being Under 13?

Individuals under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Discord unless they have permission from a parent or guardian. However, it is not very easy to prove that the user is below a certain age.

If you know someone who is undoubtedly underage, then you can report them to the Trust & Safety team by filling out their form and adding evidence to back your claim.

### Can I Report People on Discord Anonymously?

According to a [moderator on Discord's subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/ave1x3/are%5Freports%5Fanonymous/), information regarding a reported case remains between the T&S team and the reporter. Nothing regarding the complaint is shared with the individual kicked.

### What Happens If I Report Someone on Discord?

After you report someone on Discord, the T&S team goes through the evidence to justify or negate your claims.

Usually, this process takes a long time as the team evaluates whether the problem is part of a broader pattern.

After conducting their research and deciding upon a punishment, the T&S team will contact the offender via email to inform them about their misconduct and the relevant consequences.

In minor offenses, the T&S team will reach out to the reporter and teach them how to block the user rather than take direct action.

### Can You Report Someone on Discord for Being Under 13?

Individuals under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Discord unless they have permission from a parent or guardian. However, it is not very easy to prove that the user is below a certain age.

If you know someone who is undoubtedly underage, then you can report them to the Trust & Safety team by filling out their form and adding evidence to back your claim.

Discord has completely transformed online communication, becoming the preferred platform for gamers, streamers, and reviewers alike.

As of late, it has started integrating with other gaming and streaming services, giving us the streamer mode. With streaming's growing popularity, it's essential to know what the streamer mode is all about.

If you're a gamer, Discord's streamer mode allows you to stream your gaming session to viewers by broadcasting your game to your friends, fans, and even a closed community of enthusiasts.

Many e-gaming professionals have taken up streaming, offering original and valuable content for like-minded individuals. This mode helps them streamline all their communications in one place.

If you're new to Discord’s streamer mode, you need to know what it is, how you can use it to engage with other community members, and the primary security concerns you need to be aware of.

* [Part 2: How to Report Users on Discord Mobile App?](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Kick People on Discord?](#part3)
* [Part 4: FAQs About Discord Reporting](#part4)

For gamers in the modern era, Discord is a household name. The platform has around 120 million active users monthly as of early 2021.

With so many users on the forum, it is normal to have some "bad apples" in the mix. There are trolls, miscreants, and spammers who ruin the experience for everyone else.

You can report them to Discord Trust and Safety team. They would take appropriate action against these nuisances after reviewing evidence.

Reporting helps make healthier communities and allows you to avoid conflicts and outbreaks due to suspicious activity on the platform.

Today we will look into how to report someone on Discord using desktop and mobile devices. Moreover, we will look at other ways to deal with indecent behavior, such as kicking people or banning them.

## Part 1: How to Report Users on Discord Desktop

Before you can report a person to Discord's Trust and Safety team, you will need to enable Discord's developer mode.

Enabling this mode will allow you to obtain the information necessary to file your report.

1. Login to your Discord account on PC or Mac
2. You will see a gear icon next to your username to the bottom left of your screen; click on it

![ Discord User Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

1. There will be a list of options in the sidebar; from here, click on "Appearance"
2. Next, scroll down until you find "Developer Mode" under Advanced; turn it on

![ Turn on Discord Developer Mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-discord-developer-mode.jpg)

After enabling developer mode, you will now need the user ID of the person you are reporting. To get someone's user ID:

1. Right-click on their username
2. From the list of options that appear, choose "Copy ID"
3. Paste this user ID somewhere so that you can access it later

To report a specific message, you need to get the message link as well. For this:

1. Locate the message you want to report
2. Then hover your cursor over it and click on the ellipsis sign (…) on the right side
3. Click on "Copy Message Link"
4. Paste this somewhere so that you can use it later

After collecting the necessary information, go to Discord's website to report it to [Discord's Trust and Safety Team](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket%5Fform%5Fid=360000029731).

You will have to provide your email address and post the two links copied earlier into the description box.

Also, it would help if you gave context regarding your report describing how and what rule was broken. You can also provide any other evidence you may want to present by attaching files in the attachments area.

![ Submit report request on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/submit-discord-user-report-request.jpg)

Now, confirm that you are a human by completing the captcha and then click on "Submit." Discord will contact you via email if action is taken against your complaint.

## Part 2: How to Report Users on Discord on iPhone And Android

Just like on a desktop, you will first need to enable developer mode.

1. After opening Discord on your mobile device, go to user settings by tapping on the gear icon or your profile picture next to your username
2. On iPhone, tap on "Appearance" and then go to "Advanced," whereas on Android, go to "App Settings" and tap "Behavior"

![  report people on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/report-user-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Turn on developer mode by clicking on the slider under the "Chat Behavior" option

Like before, you will now need to obtain the User ID; the process may be slightly different depending on the phone you are using. In general, the steps would be:

1. Open the user's profile by tapping on it
2. Tap on the ellipsis sign (…) in the upper-right of your screen and select "Copy ID"
3. After doing this, paste the ID somewhere you can later access

Follow the steps below to get the message link to report.

1. Go to the message and then hold down on it until a list of options appears
2. On an iPhone, tap on "Copy Message Link." For an android device, click on "Select" and then "Copy To Clipboard"

Now, you can send this information to the [Trust and Safety team](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket%5Fform%5Fid=360000029731) to assess it. To do this:

1. Paste the two links copied earlier in the "Description Box"
2. Provide your email address along with the context behind the situation
3. Click on "Submit"

## Part 3: How to Kick People on Discord

Discord also allows you to take care of improper behavior yourself. If you are a moderator or server owner, you can kick people for violating Discord's guidelines.

However, it is essential to have a reason to kick someone. Otherwise, it may be seen as an abuse of power.

Here are activities to look out for before kicking someone:

* Spam messages
* Harassment
* Sharing child pornography
* Violating IP rights
* Sharing viruses
* Advocating self-harm or suicide
* Distributing gore content or animal cruelty
* Life threats to another user

If you see someone involved in these, you can kick them off your server or report them to moderators or server owners if you don't have kicking authority.

In case the moderators or owners do not act on your complaint, you can always contact the Trust and Safety team.

If you happen to be a moderator or server owner, you have the authority to kick people off your server. Here is how to do it:

1. Go to the correct channel on Discord
2. Find the user from the user list on the right side of the screen
3. Right-click on their username and then select "Kick"
4. Click on "Kick" again to confirm your decision
