## Part 2: How To Fix Voicemod Not Working Discord?

Is your voice changer Voicemod not working on Discord? No worries, you can troubleshoot the issues with a few basic steps.

Here are some ways you can use to fix Voicemod not working in Discord:

### Method 1: Restart Your Windows PC/Mac

Though it's not a technical solution, restarting your desktop computer fixes incorrect settings by rebooting them and solves many problems connected with your computer system, programs, and hardware.

So, when your Voicemod suddenly ceases to work in Discord, make sure to restart your Windows PC/Mac before going any further, as it's the first step in fixing voice issues.

If restarting doesn't help, slide to the next step!

3. Make sure to uncheck the “disable” box and keep the volume section 100
4. Click the “Start test” button and speak into the microphone
5. After that, click “Stop test.” If the greatest value it shows is above “0”, then your microphone works correctly

## Part 1: How To Use Voice Changer Voicemod For Discord On Desktop Computer

Voicemod is arguably one of the best voice changer tools available on the internet for its excellent features.

But before we jump straight into using Voicemod for Discord, you must know how to install one on your desktop Mac/PC.

### Here's how to install Voicemod

1. Visit the Voicemod website to begin the download process.
2. You'll see the button “Get Voicemod Free” on the screen. Click it!
3. Upon clicking, the site will ask you to sign in to your account from Discord, Twitch, to Google. Use your Discord login details to sign in.
4. After you're signed in, the “.exe” file will be downloaded to your PC/Mac's download folder. Open the “.exe” file the moment it's downloaded.
5. An install wizard will open up. Navigate through the wizard's installation process to install the program on your PC/Mac.
6. After installation is complete, the installation wizard will ask to restart your windows' Mac or PC.

You can skip it, but it's best to restart it for smooth operations.

Once your Mac/PC restarts, you'll see the Voicemod app icon on your desktop screen.

Now that you have successfully installed the voice changer Voicemod app into your desktop computer, let's dive into knowing **how to use Voicemod on Discord**!

### Here's how to use voice changer on Discord

1. Click the Vociemod icon on the desktop to open the app. If you can't find it there, click the “windows icon” located at the screen's bottom-left. Just type “Voicemod,” and the program will show up. Double click it to get it opened.
2. When the app opens up, you'll have to choose the output and input it will use. If you're wondering, why the output? This is to give you an insight into what your voice will sound like on each filter.

Once it's done, you can play around with different filters!

Every day, you'll get new free filters to use; however, to unlock and access all filters, you need to upgrade to the “pro-version” of voice changer Voicemod.

On the other hand, if you only need a few filters, the “basic-version” should suffice.

Apart from that, you can unlock an additional free filter in your app by sharing it on your social media accounts.
