Discord is one of the fastest-growing instant communication platforms. It started as just a messaging and [voice chat app for gamers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) but today it has expanded into every PC. From gaming to just general chatting, it is used by everyone. Discord also provides bots and features to expand the user's experience. One of the types of bots that are available on Discord servers is music bots.

This article covers everything you need to know about Discord Music Bots:

* [Part 1: What is Discord Music Bot?](#part1)
* [Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Add a Music Bot to Discord?](#part3)
* [Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?](#part4)
* [Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?](#bonus) \[Free to Use\]

## Part 1: What is Discord Music Bot?

Discord allows users to create servers where they can then invite their friends or people who have the same interest, or people playing the same game. Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.

**Discord music bots** provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time. Discord music bots can find songs on YouTube, Spotify, or other platforms and play them on a Discord voice channel.

## Part 3: How to Add a Music Bot to Discord?

Adding a music bot to your server is very simple and only takes one click. Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.

This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.

Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.

After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members' area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.

## Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?

Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.

Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type _–help_ for Groovy and similarly for every other bot (\[specified prefix\]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.

Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.

You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the _–loop track_ command. And loop your whole queue using –_loop queue_. You can turn the loop off by –_loop off_.

If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the _–queue_ command.

In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.

## Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?

Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use [Filmore Discord video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size. Filmora owns popular video effects and filters to make your video look professional, plus, it possesses a huge library that offers multiple music tracks for you to use.

## Part 3: How to Add a Music Bot to Discord?

Adding a music bot to your server is very simple and only takes one click. Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.

This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.

Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.

After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members' area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.

## Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?

Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.

Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type _–help_ for Groovy and similarly for every other bot (\[specified prefix\]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.

Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.

You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the _–loop track_ command. And loop your whole queue using –_loop queue_. You can turn the loop off by –_loop off_.

If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the _–queue_ command.

In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.

## Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?

Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use [Filmore Discord video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size.

## Part 1: What is Discord Music Bot?

Discord allows users to create servers where they can then invite their friends or people who have the same interest, or people playing the same game. Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.

**Discord music bots** provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time. Discord music bots can find songs on YouTube, Spotify, or other platforms and play them on a Discord voice channel.

### 7. BMO [](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/418412306981191680)

This Music bot was inspired by the Adventure-Time Character BMO. This music bot is fun to use and provides the functionality of a high level of bot.

It is the best bot, in my opinion, to liven up your server especially if it has a general chat room.

**Pros**

* Smooth lag-free High-Quality Music.
* Small chat games to make a user's time on your server more fun.
* NSFW commands for those channels as well.
* The bot is also DMCA protected which means it’s not violating any copyright laws.

### 8. 24/7 [](https://24-7music.com)

24/7 is another one of my favorite free music bots. It not only provides high-quality music streaming from major websites like YouTube, Spotify, and mixer. But it also allows streaming from any radio station around the world.

24/7 was created by Deluxe to provide non-stop music for its users. It has a small number of commands to keep it concise and to the point.

* mb play \[link to internet radio stream\]
* mb pause \*
* mb resume \*
* mb np
* mb volume \[volume percentage\] \*
* mb help

_\[\] = optional parameter_

_\* = premium only commands_

The premium version can be bought for $2.47 which along with the commands unlocks these features:

#### Premium features of 24/7

\- YouTube queue, including pause, resume, skip, add, remove, export, import, etc.

\- YouTube playlist support

\- control the volume, server-wide

But if you like the bot you can get the $7.24 version which provides all the above-mentioned benefits and a message on your server stating that you donated to the creators of this bot.

**Pros**

The Best thing about 24/7 is that it can stream any live event from Youtube as well. So, you can listen to a talk show, a podcast, or any other live event while playing your favorite games.

### 9. [Mantaro](https://mantaro.site/)

A personal favorite that I have on my server is Mantaro. It, like all the bots mentioned before, provides great quality music streaming from all major sources.

This bot is the go-to for an anime lover or an anime discord server. It comes with everything you need to make it fun, lively, and interactive even when people aren’t playing games and just chatting.

**Pros**

* Mantaro has so many features. From a currency system to mining activities, gifts, XP, chopping, fishing, pets, and everything.
* Birthday roles and announcements.
* Games (such as trivia, guess the character, guess the number, and guess the Pokémon _remember that on the TV back then?_)
* Anime and Character lookup command. And don’t forget the NSFW commands for lewd anime pics.
* It also provides RP commands for all the RP lovers out there.

Mantaro makes your server into more of a second life for you.

### 10. [ErisBot](https://erisbot.com/)

ErisBot is a strong and very simple-to-use music bot.

The best feature about ErisBot that separates it from the rest is that it allows you to create your very own custom prefixes for the commands.

One thing I noticed is that sometimes instead of playing audio from the YouTube link, it starts playing the video. Maybe it mixes up the commands or whatever. This is something you’ll have to keep in mind while using Eris Bot.

But if you like the bot you can get the $7.24 version which provides all the above-mentioned benefits and a message on your server stating that you donated to the creators of this bot.

**Pros**

The Best thing about 24/7 is that it can stream any live event from Youtube as well. So, you can listen to a talk show, a podcast, or any other live event while playing your favorite games.

### 9. [Mantaro](https://mantaro.site/)

A personal favorite that I have on my server is Mantaro. It, like all the bots mentioned before, provides great quality music streaming from all major sources.

This bot is the go-to for an anime lover or an anime discord server. It comes with everything you need to make it fun, lively, and interactive even when people aren’t playing games and just chatting.

**Pros**

* Mantaro has so many features. From a currency system to mining activities, gifts, XP, chopping, fishing, pets, and everything.
* Birthday roles and announcements.
* Games (such as trivia, guess the character, guess the number, and guess the Pokémon _remember that on the TV back then?_)
* Anime and Character lookup command. And don’t forget the NSFW commands for lewd anime pics.
* It also provides RP commands for all the RP lovers out there.

Mantaro makes your server into more of a second life for you.

### 10. [ErisBot](https://erisbot.com/)

ErisBot is a strong and very simple-to-use music bot.

The best feature about ErisBot that separates it from the rest is that it allows you to create your very own custom prefixes for the commands.

One thing I noticed is that sometimes instead of playing audio from the YouTube link, it starts playing the video. Maybe it mixes up the commands or whatever. This is something you’ll have to keep in mind while using Eris Bot.

## Part 3: How to Add a Music Bot to Discord?

Adding a music bot to your server is very simple and only takes one click. Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.

This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.

Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.

After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members' area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.

## Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?

Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.

Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type _–help_ for Groovy and similarly for every other bot (\[specified prefix\]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.

Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.

You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the _–loop track_ command. And loop your whole queue using –_loop queue_. You can turn the loop off by –_loop off_.

If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the _–queue_ command.

In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.

## Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?

Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use [Filmore Discord video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size. Filmora owns popular video effects and filters to make your video look professional, plus, it possesses a huge library that offers multiple music tracks for you to use.

See how powerful the Filmora is!

Discord is packed with great features, but one thing it’s missing is a screen recorder. You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.

Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.

One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.

## Part 1: Best Windows/Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord

If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust [screen recording tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.

### 1. OBS

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.

There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.

### 2. Bandicam

Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.

Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn't involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95\. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.

### 3. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features [screen recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 4. DemoCreator

If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider [Wondershare DemoCreator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/). Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.

You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.

### 5. Camtasia

If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.

However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.

## Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord

If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.

### 2. Screen Capture

One such option is [Screen Capture](https://www.screencapture.com/), which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.

There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

### 3. Clipchamp

If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/). Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.

It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.

### 3. Screencast-o-matic

The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is [Screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder). This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.

The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.

## Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android

If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.

### 1. AZ Screen Recorder

[AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US) is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.

It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.

### 2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots

Another option for Android is [‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US). Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.

The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.

### 3. Record It

If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘[Record It!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545)’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.

The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.

## Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?

If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.

Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.

You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.

If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.

Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.

The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.

There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.

### 2. Bandicam

Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.

Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn't involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95\. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.

### 3. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features [screen recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.

### 4. DemoCreator

If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider [Wondershare DemoCreator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/). Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.

You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.

### 5. Camtasia

If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.

However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.

## Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord

If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.

### 2. Screen Capture

One such option is [Screen Capture](https://www.screencapture.com/), which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.

There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

### 3. Clipchamp

If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/). Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.

It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.

### 3. Screencast-o-matic

The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is [Screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder). This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.

The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.

## Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android

If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.

### 1. AZ Screen Recorder

[AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US) is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.

It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.

### 2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots

Another option for Android is [‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US). Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.

The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.

### 3. Record It

If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘[Record It!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545)’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.

The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.

## Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?

If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.

Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.

You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.

If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.

Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.

The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.

Discord is packed with great features, but one thing it’s missing is a screen recorder. You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.

Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.

One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.
