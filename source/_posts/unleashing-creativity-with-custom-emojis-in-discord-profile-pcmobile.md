## **Part 3: FAQs about Discord Dating Servers**

**1 - Are dating servers on discord allowed?**

Discord's director of Trust and Safety, Sean Li, says underage dating channels are against company policy. They don’t allow servers designed to access teen dating on their platform. Whenever they become aware of dating Discord servers, we quickly shut down and investigate any violating servers.

The official Discord for the Fortnite game is the largest Discord server in the world.
