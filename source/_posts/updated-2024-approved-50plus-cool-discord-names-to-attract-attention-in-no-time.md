Regarding the origin, Discord allows you and different individuals to text each other. Here, almost every group is named a "server." All in all, it's more of a standard version of Slack for ease of understanding.

Servers packed with different text channels and voice channels are places where you can interact with each other.

In this guide, you will gather all the cool and funny Discord names collected and crafted after an intensive amount of research.
