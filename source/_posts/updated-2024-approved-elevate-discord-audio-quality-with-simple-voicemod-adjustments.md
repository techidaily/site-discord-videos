## Part 1: How To Use Voice Changer Voicemod For Discord On Desktop Computer

Voicemod is arguably one of the best voice changer tools available on the internet for its excellent features.

But before we jump straight into using Voicemod for Discord, you must know how to install one on your desktop Mac/PC.

### Here's how to install Voicemod

1. Visit the Voicemod website to begin the download process.
2. You'll see the button “Get Voicemod Free” on the screen. Click it!
3. Upon clicking, the site will ask you to sign in to your account from Discord, Twitch, to Google. Use your Discord login details to sign in.
4. After you're signed in, the “.exe” file will be downloaded to your PC/Mac's download folder. Open the “.exe” file the moment it's downloaded.
5. An install wizard will open up. Navigate through the wizard's installation process to install the program on your PC/Mac.
6. After installation is complete, the installation wizard will ask to restart your windows' Mac or PC.

You can skip it, but it's best to restart it for smooth operations.

Once your Mac/PC restarts, you'll see the Voicemod app icon on your desktop screen.

Now that you have successfully installed the voice changer Voicemod app into your desktop computer, let's dive into knowing **how to use Voicemod on Discord**!

### Here's how to use voice changer on Discord

1. Click the Vociemod icon on the desktop to open the app. If you can't find it there, click the “windows icon” located at the screen's bottom-left. Just type “Voicemod,” and the program will show up. Double click it to get it opened.
2. When the app opens up, you'll have to choose the output and input it will use. If you're wondering, why the output? This is to give you an insight into what your voice will sound like on each filter.

Once it's done, you can play around with different filters!

Every day, you'll get new free filters to use; however, to unlock and access all filters, you need to upgrade to the “pro-version” of voice changer Voicemod.

On the other hand, if you only need a few filters, the “basic-version” should suffice.

Apart from that, you can unlock an additional free filter in your app by sharing it on your social media accounts.

![Set up Voicemod for Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-voicemod-discord.jpg)

#### Step 1

To set up Voicemod with Discord, open your discord account and go to the settings (gear icon) placed at the screen's bottom-left corner.

#### Step 2

Click the “Voice and Video” option right under the app settings.

#### Step 3

To make Voicemod usable, you'll have to change Voice settings. Within the “Input Device” option, select the option that says “Microphone Voicemod Virtual Audio.”

#### Step 4

After you have changed settings, you can easily change the voice within the program. Not only this, but other users can also hear your audio alteration.

#### Step 5

With the “basic version,” you'll have seven free voice choices that will change each day. On the contrary, with the “pro-version,” you'll gain access to more than 80 different voice options.

So, if you're searching for an easy and simple voice-changing app to use, look no further than Voicemod!

## Part 2: How To Fix Voicemod Not Working Discord?

Is your voice changer Voicemod not working on Discord? No worries, you can troubleshoot the issues with a few basic steps.

Here are some ways you can use to fix Voicemod not working in Discord:

### Method 1: Restart Your Windows PC/Mac

Though it's not a technical solution, restarting your desktop computer fixes incorrect settings by rebooting them and solves many problems connected with your computer system, programs, and hardware.

So, when your Voicemod suddenly ceases to work in Discord, make sure to restart your Windows PC/Mac before going any further, as it's the first step in fixing voice issues.

If restarting doesn't help, slide to the next step!

### Method 2: Make Sure The Mic Is Properly Set

Just follow the steps below to resolve it:

1. On the keyboard, press the “Win” logo and the “I” key simultaneously to open Windows settings. Click “System.”
2. On the left, you'll see the option “Sound.” Click it.

2. Click “Device properties & test microphone”
3. Make sure to uncheck the “disable” box and keep the volume section 100
4. Click the “Start test” button and speak into the microphone
5. After that, click “Stop test.” If the greatest value it shows is above “0”, then your microphone works correctly

Now, restart your Voicemod app to see if it's working properly or not! If the issue still persists, jump to the next solution.

### Method 4:Re-Install Voice Changer Voicemod Drivers

### Here's how to install Voicemod

1. Visit the Voicemod website to begin the download process.
2. You'll see the button “Get Voicemod Free” on the screen. Click it!
3. Upon clicking, the site will ask you to sign in to your account from Discord, Twitch, to Google. Use your Discord login details to sign in.
4. After you're signed in, the “.exe” file will be downloaded to your PC/Mac's download folder. Open the “.exe” file the moment it's downloaded.
5. An install wizard will open up. Navigate through the wizard's installation process to install the program on your PC/Mac.
6. After installation is complete, the installation wizard will ask to restart your windows' Mac or PC.

You can skip it, but it's best to restart it for smooth operations.

Once your Mac/PC restarts, you'll see the Voicemod app icon on your desktop screen.

Now that you have successfully installed the voice changer Voicemod app into your desktop computer, let's dive into knowing **how to use Voicemod on Discord**!

### Here's how to use voice changer on Discord

1. Click the Vociemod icon on the desktop to open the app. If you can't find it there, click the “windows icon” located at the screen's bottom-left. Just type “Voicemod,” and the program will show up. Double click it to get it opened.
2. When the app opens up, you'll have to choose the output and input it will use. If you're wondering, why the output? This is to give you an insight into what your voice will sound like on each filter.

Once it's done, you can play around with different filters!

Every day, you'll get new free filters to use; however, to unlock and access all filters, you need to upgrade to the “pro-version” of voice changer Voicemod.

On the other hand, if you only need a few filters, the “basic-version” should suffice.

Apart from that, you can unlock an additional free filter in your app by sharing it on your social media accounts.

#### Step 1

To set up Voicemod with Discord, open your discord account and go to the settings (gear icon) placed at the screen's bottom-left corner.

#### Step 2

Click the “Voice and Video” option right under the app settings.

#### Step 3

To make Voicemod usable, you'll have to change Voice settings. Within the “Input Device” option, select the option that says “Microphone Voicemod Virtual Audio.”

#### Step 4

After you have changed settings, you can easily change the voice within the program. Not only this, but other users can also hear your audio alteration.

#### Step 5

With the “basic version,” you'll have seven free voice choices that will change each day. On the contrary, with the “pro-version,” you'll gain access to more than 80 different voice options.

So, if you're searching for an easy and simple voice-changing app to use, look no further than Voicemod!

## Part 2: How To Fix Voicemod Not Working Discord?

Is your voice changer Voicemod not working on Discord? No worries, you can troubleshoot the issues with a few basic steps.

Here are some ways you can use to fix Voicemod not working in Discord:

### Method 1: Restart Your Windows PC/Mac

Though it's not a technical solution, restarting your desktop computer fixes incorrect settings by rebooting them and solves many problems connected with your computer system, programs, and hardware.

So, when your Voicemod suddenly ceases to work in Discord, make sure to restart your Windows PC/Mac before going any further, as it's the first step in fixing voice issues.

If restarting doesn't help, slide to the next step!

### Method 2: Make Sure The Mic Is Properly Set

The next step is to check if the mic works correctly. This is because faulty settings may stop voice changer Voicemod from operating correctly.

Just follow the steps below to resolve it:

1. On the keyboard, press the “Win” logo and the “I” key simultaneously to open Windows settings. Click “System.”
2. On the left, you'll see the option “Sound.” Click it.

![Set up Windows Sound for Voicemod](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-windows-sound.jpg)

1. First, you have to test the microphone! To do so, choose the “Headset” option rather than the Voicemod microphone under the “Input” section
2. Click “Device properties & test microphone”
3. Make sure to uncheck the “disable” box and keep the volume section 100
4. Click the “Start test” button and speak into the microphone
5. After that, click “Stop test.” If the greatest value it shows is above “0”, then your microphone works correctly

Now, restart your Voicemod app to see if it's working properly or not! If the issue still persists, jump to the next solution.

### Method 3: Install Windows Updates

If you use Windows 10, it has two kinds of updates that offer performance boost and security patches. Sometimes, an update can fix a few driver and software conflicts automatically.

You can quickly solve the voice chat problem by simply updating the system settings. Here's how to update your Windows 10:

1. Open your windows setting by pressing the “Windows button” and the “I” key together.
2. Click on “Update and Security”
3. Click the “Check for Updates” button. If an update is found, it will install automatically on the system

Make sure to repeat this process until it says you're up-to-date. Then, restart the PC. Check whether the Vociemod is properly working or not!

If not, try our next option!

### Method 4:Re-Install Voice Changer Voicemod Drivers

In many instances, the issue signifies that you're using outdated or faulty drivers. To troubleshoot this, simply re-install your Voicemod driver, and you'll be good to go!

First, uninstall your Voicemod driver from the windows PC/Mac. Here's how to do it:

1. On the keyboard, press the “Windows button” as well as the “I” key to bring up the “Run box”

3. Click the “expand” option of “Audio Inputs & Outputs.”
4. Click the “Microphone WMD” and choose the “Uninstall device” option

A **Discord banner** is best to customize your Discord account and make it more convincing. It allows you to improvise your profile icon with one of your favorite movies, games, memes, or anime characters. You can even decorate the space with your face.

Before looking at the steps to create a Discord profile banner, it’s crucial to note that only Nitro users can use this feature. You’ll have to settle for a limited list of 10-15 pre-made banners if you’ve not yet accessed the Nitro plan. These Discord banners feature solid colors and basic designs. What’s more, you can’t modify your banner for Discord on the Discord mobile apps. It’s only accessible via desktop versions.

In this article, we'll discuss the top 9 Discord banner makers, plus a helpful section on how to create your Discord banner.

* [Part 1: Top 9 Discord Banner Makers in 2022 \[with free templates\]](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Create a Discord Banner with Kapwing](#part2)
* [Part 3: FAQs about Discord Banner](#part3)

## **Part 1: Top 9 Discord Banner Makers in 2022 \[with free templates\]**

### 1. [Visme](http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/)

![discord banner maker visme](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-visme.jpg)

Visme offers 50 plus free channel art editable templates through their online graphics service. However, it has a bit more complex UI than some of the other makers on this list, but the free templates are wonderful, and you can upload your images to edit with them.

### 2. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html)

![fotor - discord banner maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fotor.jpg)

Another graphics program with free templates is Fotor. It is easy to use – perhaps the most accessible program on this list. You click on the element in your template and then click on what you want to replace it with, and thus you don't even have to use the drag and drop feature in the '**background’** tab. Of course, you can upload your photos as well.

There are subscription options in Fotor. Thus, you get a watermark for your project unless you pay for premium services, but there are enough free options to satisfy most creators.

### 3. [Snappa](https://snappa.com/create/youtube-channel-art)

![discord banner maker - snappa](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-snappa.jpg)

If you want to get something quick in design, Snappa is the right choice. First, choose one of the free templates under the **YouTube Channel Art under the Headers** tab. Then it’s just a matter of elements swapping in the template with ones that suit your channel.

Snappa shows you the ideal placement section for different devices while you edit.

### 4. [Crello](https://blog.crello.com/a-collection-of-free-youtube-channel-art-templates/)

![discord banner maker crello](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crello-highlight-cover-editing-interface.jpg)

Crello provides ten free examples of channel art templates through their blog, and you can rightly edit them on the site.

Crello is a simple visual editor designed for social media and marketing creators, meaning that non-design people can quickly jump into this platform. Beyond the free text options and templates, however, most of their backgrounds and stock photos cost $1\. You’re required to use the default images to use Crello for free or upload your own.

### 5. [Design Wizard](https://www.designwizard.com/)

![discord banner design wizard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-design-wizard.jpg)

This is another Discord banner maker with a few free templates to design or craft anything out through personalization. One of the best valuable abilities of the design wizard is that it will display the 'safe zone' – the area of your Discord banner that will show up on any device screen – so you can design keeping those dimensions in mind.

Also, make sure to delete the safe zone marker before you export.

### 6. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

![discord banner maker canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-montage.jpg)

Canva is one of the famous and free channel art makers. It is simple with a drag-and-drop editor. Also, the program will automatically resize images to adjust easily within the Discord banner space. It has a variety of free resources like stock photos. Some resources are paid ($1), but most of them are free.

### 7. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker)

While editing the Discord banner templates via Adobe Spark, click on the resources in the template and then select the images/fonts/etc., that you want to use. Resources like filters are also very accessible.

The only drawback of Spark is that the watermarks are in free downloads. However, the watermark is quite small, meaning that it won't show up for viewers as it is placed in the bottom-right corner watching your channel on either mobile devices or computers.

Note: Whenever you click 'Create your YouTube channel art,' it will show you a thumbnail template instead of a banner template. Hit the **Resize** button in the side menu and switch to your exported images or the channel art.

### 8. [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/)

![discord banner maker befunky](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-befunky.jpg)

This is a graphics creator platform that doubles as a Discord profile banner maker as well. You need to head towards BeFunky’s ‘**Designer**’ tool and look for the channel art templates under ‘**YouTube**’ and ‘**Social Media Headers**.’ However, we won’t find here any free art templates.

### 9. [Wondershare PixStudio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/)

![discord banner maker pixstudio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pixstudio-online-graphic-design-maker.jpg)

Wondershare PixStudio has certain unique features to erase the image background. With a single tap only, you can quickly remove the image background; then, you can use your image flexibly. And, it's just a subscription of $7.99 per month to use the features.

## Part 2: How to Create a Discord Banner with Kapwing

Since your server banner will take up an important place in your Discord server, you must make yours look just right. You have to consider the dimensions, formatting, and arrangement of the Discord profile banner.

* Use optimal dimensions
* Make sure the important parts are visible
* How to upload your banner image

#### Step 1: Use Optimal Dimensions

Discord recommends that your image have optimal dimensions of 960x540 at least, which is different than 16:9 images. You can use a slightly larger 16:9 aspect ratio for great appearances, like 1920x1080 or even 2560x1440.

With Kapwing Studio, you can crop any photo to a 16:9 aspect ratio and resize it to the given dimensions. Visit Kapwing.com in your browser, click **Start Editing**, and paste the link to a photo you found online or upload your image directly on the Studio.

Now, click the **Crop** tool to make your photo 16:9, and head towards the **Output Size** options to make your aspect ratio larger than 960x540.

#### Step 2: Make Sure the Important Parts Are Visible

This is the essential part of setting up your Discord banner – making sure your banner is properly visible on the Discord.

Your banner image's safe zone is that you should keep ideal sections out of the top 28% since that's where your server's options and name button will show.

The portion is a bit covered with text about the top 22% of your Discord banner photo. So, keep important sections and the text of your image below the top 120 pixels on a 960x540 Discord banner.

![kapwing discord banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/kapwing-discord-banner-1.jpg)

Now, you must note that the Discord profile banner will display as it starts fading about halfway down until merging in with the bottom-edge dark grey area of Discord.

And, you can smoothly edit any design elements, titles, text, or essential visuals at the bottom of the Discord profile banner. You should relocate them closer to the frame's center to be visible.

![make discord banner with kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/kapwing-discord-banner-2.jpg)

_Source: kapwing.com_

Hit the Crop button in the Kapwing Studio to add text boxes for banner personalization and horizontally flip your images to keep elements aside from the upper left corner. Hit the green Export Image button after you are over with cropping, then the Download button to save your banner to your device.

#### Step 3: Upload Your Banner Image

Adding a Discord profile banner is intuitive once your server boosts enough to reach level 2\. Just open your server dropdown menu and hit the **Server Settings**, then choose "**Upload Background**."

![discord banner server settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-server-settings.jpg)

Here, look for the image in your camera roll or files and upload it to your Discord channel server. It's that simple!

## Part 3: FAQs about Discord Banner

#### 1 - How do you make a banner on Discord?

You can consider various banner makers mentioned above to make a banner on Discord. However, you have to ensure compliance with Discord banner size requirements.

#### 2 - How do I get free Discord banners?

You can find free custom Discord Banner images already optimized and cropped for the Discord banner. Browse thousands of profile banners in categories like animated, meme, etc., on [pfps.gg website](https://pfps.gg/banners) to get free discord banners.

#### 3 – Can the Discord banner be GIF?

Yes, uploading a Discord banner in GIF format is allowed.

## Conclusion

The ability to set a Discord banner is part of the Discord update called "**Custom Profiles Premium**."

The feature is live on Discord, which means that everyone can modify or set Discord profile banners as per their likes and preferences. However, you must have access to Discord Nitro to change your profile banner. And, users who don't have Discord Nitro are not allowed to set a profile banner.

![discord banner maker visme](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-visme.jpg)

Visme offers 50 plus free channel art editable templates through their online graphics service. However, it has a bit more complex UI than some of the other makers on this list, but the free templates are wonderful, and you can upload your images to edit with them.

### 2. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html)

![fotor - discord banner maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fotor.jpg)

Another graphics program with free templates is Fotor. It is easy to use – perhaps the most accessible program on this list. You click on the element in your template and then click on what you want to replace it with, and thus you don't even have to use the drag and drop feature in the '**background’** tab. Of course, you can upload your photos as well.

There are subscription options in Fotor. Thus, you get a watermark for your project unless you pay for premium services, but there are enough free options to satisfy most creators.

### 3. [Snappa](https://snappa.com/create/youtube-channel-art)

![discord banner maker - snappa](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-snappa.jpg)

If you want to get something quick in design, Snappa is the right choice. First, choose one of the free templates under the **YouTube Channel Art under the Headers** tab. Then it’s just a matter of elements swapping in the template with ones that suit your channel.

Snappa shows you the ideal placement section for different devices while you edit.

### 4. [Crello](https://blog.crello.com/a-collection-of-free-youtube-channel-art-templates/)

![discord banner maker crello](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crello-highlight-cover-editing-interface.jpg)

Crello provides ten free examples of channel art templates through their blog, and you can rightly edit them on the site.

Crello is a simple visual editor designed for social media and marketing creators, meaning that non-design people can quickly jump into this platform. Beyond the free text options and templates, however, most of their backgrounds and stock photos cost $1\. You’re required to use the default images to use Crello for free or upload your own.

### 5. [Design Wizard](https://www.designwizard.com/)

![discord banner design wizard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-design-wizard.jpg)

This is another Discord banner maker with a few free templates to design or craft anything out through personalization. One of the best valuable abilities of the design wizard is that it will display the 'safe zone' – the area of your Discord banner that will show up on any device screen – so you can design keeping those dimensions in mind.

Also, make sure to delete the safe zone marker before you export.

### 6. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

![discord banner maker canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-montage.jpg)

Canva is one of the famous and free channel art makers. It is simple with a drag-and-drop editor. Also, the program will automatically resize images to adjust easily within the Discord banner space. It has a variety of free resources like stock photos. Some resources are paid ($1), but most of them are free.

### 7. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker)

While editing the Discord banner templates via Adobe Spark, click on the resources in the template and then select the images/fonts/etc., that you want to use. Resources like filters are also very accessible.

The only drawback of Spark is that the watermarks are in free downloads. However, the watermark is quite small, meaning that it won't show up for viewers as it is placed in the bottom-right corner watching your channel on either mobile devices or computers.

Note: Whenever you click 'Create your YouTube channel art,' it will show you a thumbnail template instead of a banner template. Hit the **Resize** button in the side menu and switch to your exported images or the channel art.

### 8. [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/)

![discord banner maker befunky](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-maker-befunky.jpg)

This is a graphics creator platform that doubles as a Discord profile banner maker as well. You need to head towards BeFunky’s ‘**Designer**’ tool and look for the channel art templates under ‘**YouTube**’ and ‘**Social Media Headers**.’ However, we won’t find here any free art templates.

### 9. [Wondershare PixStudio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/)

![discord banner maker pixstudio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pixstudio-online-graphic-design-maker.jpg)

Wondershare PixStudio has certain unique features to erase the image background. With a single tap only, you can quickly remove the image background; then, you can use your image flexibly. And, it's just a subscription of $7.99 per month to use the features.

## Part 2: How to Create a Discord Banner with Kapwing

Since your server banner will take up an important place in your Discord server, you must make yours look just right. You have to consider the dimensions, formatting, and arrangement of the Discord profile banner.

* Use optimal dimensions
* Make sure the important parts are visible
* How to upload your banner image

#### Step 1: Use Optimal Dimensions

Discord recommends that your image have optimal dimensions of 960x540 at least, which is different than 16:9 images. You can use a slightly larger 16:9 aspect ratio for great appearances, like 1920x1080 or even 2560x1440.

With Kapwing Studio, you can crop any photo to a 16:9 aspect ratio and resize it to the given dimensions. Visit Kapwing.com in your browser, click **Start Editing**, and paste the link to a photo you found online or upload your image directly on the Studio.

Now, click the **Crop** tool to make your photo 16:9, and head towards the **Output Size** options to make your aspect ratio larger than 960x540.

#### Step 2: Make Sure the Important Parts Are Visible

This is the essential part of setting up your Discord banner – making sure your banner is properly visible on the Discord.

Your banner image's safe zone is that you should keep ideal sections out of the top 28% since that's where your server's options and name button will show.

The portion is a bit covered with text about the top 22% of your Discord banner photo. So, keep important sections and the text of your image below the top 120 pixels on a 960x540 Discord banner.

![kapwing discord banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/kapwing-discord-banner-1.jpg)

Now, you must note that the Discord profile banner will display as it starts fading about halfway down until merging in with the bottom-edge dark grey area of Discord.

And, you can smoothly edit any design elements, titles, text, or essential visuals at the bottom of the Discord profile banner. You should relocate them closer to the frame's center to be visible.

![make discord banner with kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/kapwing-discord-banner-2.jpg)

_Source: kapwing.com_

Hit the Crop button in the Kapwing Studio to add text boxes for banner personalization and horizontally flip your images to keep elements aside from the upper left corner. Hit the green Export Image button after you are over with cropping, then the Download button to save your banner to your device.

#### Step 3: Upload Your Banner Image

Adding a Discord profile banner is intuitive once your server boosts enough to reach level 2\. Just open your server dropdown menu and hit the **Server Settings**, then choose "**Upload Background**."

![discord banner server settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-banner-server-settings.jpg)

Here, look for the image in your camera roll or files and upload it to your Discord channel server. It's that simple!

## Part 3: FAQs about Discord Banner

#### 1 - How do you make a banner on Discord?

You can consider various banner makers mentioned above to make a banner on Discord. However, you have to ensure compliance with Discord banner size requirements.

#### 2 - How do I get free Discord banners?

You can find free custom Discord Banner images already optimized and cropped for the Discord banner. Browse thousands of profile banners in categories like animated, meme, etc., on [pfps.gg website](https://pfps.gg/banners) to get free discord banners.

#### 3 – Can the Discord banner be GIF?

Yes, uploading a Discord banner in GIF format is allowed.

## Conclusion

The ability to set a Discord banner is part of the Discord update called "**Custom Profiles Premium**."

The feature is live on Discord, which means that everyone can modify or set Discord profile banners as per their likes and preferences. However, you must have access to Discord Nitro to change your profile banner. And, users who don't have Discord Nitro are not allowed to set a profile banner.

A **Discord banner** is best to customize your Discord account and make it more convincing. It allows you to improvise your profile icon with one of your favorite movies, games, memes, or anime characters. You can even decorate the space with your face.

Before looking at the steps to create a Discord profile banner, it’s crucial to note that only Nitro users can use this feature. You’ll have to settle for a limited list of 10-15 pre-made banners if you’ve not yet accessed the Nitro plan. These Discord banners feature solid colors and basic designs. What’s more, you can’t modify your banner for Discord on the Discord mobile apps. It’s only accessible via desktop versions.

In this article, we'll discuss the top 9 Discord banner makers, plus a helpful section on how to create your Discord banner.
