**Step 1:** First, you need to go to <https://discord.com>. Once you visit the site, please log in using your Discord credential.

**Step 2:** Once your profile is open, please click on the profile picture.

**Step 3:** On your profile, look at the bottom of the menu. You will see a pop-up menu that says set a custom status.

**Step 4:** On the emojis bar, you can add an emoji. To do that, you need to click on the emoji status. Next, you will see a list of emojis. Please note that only an active Nitro subscription user can use animated or custom emojis. On the left will be the category of emojis. Choose one category that suits your mood; once the category opens, click on an emoji to add it.

**Step 5:** After that, you need to click on the Today option. This will open a drop-down menu. You need to choose a time frame for the emoji or status. You can choose today, 4 hours, 1 hour, etc.

**Step 6:** If you are done with the emoji selection and have chosen the duration for the status, you need to click on the Save option. The Save option will be on the bottom right of the same pop-up window.

And that’s it. The emojis will be successfully added to your status based on the duration that you have chosen. If you want to change the emoji or remove it, you need to undergo the same process.

**Step 4:** Open Discord and click on the user settings. There, you will see the Better Discord section. Next, click on the Plugin option. Now, close the Discord window and drag the animated status dot plugin into the plugin folder that opened after clicking on the Plugin option.

**Step 5:** Go to Discord again, and you will see the Animated Status option. Enable it and click on the gear icon. To add an animated emoji, click on the + icon. Next, you will see a Nitro ID field. Then, go to a chat page and click on the emoji option.

**Step 6:** Look at the emoji that you like and memorize the animated emoji name. Press \\ followed by the name of the emoji. Now, copy the whole text and paste it again.
