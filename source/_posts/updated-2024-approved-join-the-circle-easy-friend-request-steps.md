 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord is a widely used platform for gaming, joining new online communities, stream games with friends, meet new people, and chat. In 2019, Discord had over 250 million users. And over 6 million servers. And these numbers keep bloating every year.

If you are new to discord, it might take you a while to get the hang of the app. **How to add friends on Discord**? Moreover, discord is no fun without active servers or friends. But we are here to help you add friends on discord.

Before that – why would you want to add friends on Discord? Well, why not! You can chat with them personally, show off your gaming skills by streaming games, or add them to your servers!

## Part 1: How to Add Friends on Discord on Computer?

Discord is supposed to make gaming an interactive and lively experience. So, you should start adding friends right away. Here are the steps for adding friends on Discord. The process is the same for the desktop app and browser Discord. You can add friends through two ways -

### How to Add friends directly on Discord desktop

With this method, you can add friends using their Discord username and tag. Make sure you have their tag.

If you are using a desktop app or the website, here is how you can add friends -

1. Open the desktop app or visit the site. Tap the home button on the top towards the left.
2. Open the direct message list. In the list, click on the ‘Add friend’ tab.

![ Add friends directly on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-directly-discord.jpg)

1. In the menu that appears, input your friend's discord tag in the search box. Make sure that the capitalization, spelling, spaces or numbers are correct.
2. Hit the send friend request button to send the friend request.

![ Send friends request on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/send-friend-request-on-discord.jpg)

1. The friend will appear in your friend list once they accept your friend request.

Now you can chat with them personally.

### 2\. How to add friends on Discord Server

Severs are the places where you find your best buddies who obsess over the same things. If you want to add a friend that you met on a server, follow these steps -

1. Open the server that you and your friend are a part of.
2. Tap on your friend’s profile. You can find their profile in the user list of the server.

![ add friends on Discord server](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-on-discord-server.jpg)

1. View their profile. Click open the profile's menu.
2. Hit the Add Friend option and once the person accepts your request, you will find them in your friend list.

You can directly text or call the people who get added to your friend list.

Similarly, if a person (who’s not on your Friends List) has messaged you directly, you add them as a friend quickly.

To do this, open your chat list by clicking on your profile. Find the person you want to add to the chat list, and right-click on their profile. Tap the ‘Add Friend’ option. This is the fastest way to add friends on Discord without their user tag.

## Part 2: How to Add friends on Discord on Android and iOS?

The user interface of discord is more or less the same across various devices. The process of adding friends is quite similar to the one we discussed for the computer.

You cannot use discord over a phone's browser. To use discord on your phone, you have to download the app. It is available on Google Play Store and App Store. Once you have downloaded the app and logged in, here is **how to add people on Discord**.

### 1\. How to Add friends directly on Discord Mobile

If you have some friends that you do not share common channels with, you can add them directly with their username and Discord tag. Make sure you note down their user name and tag.

1. Open the discord app.
2. Tap on the Friends button that is located towards the bottom.

![ add friends on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friend-on-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Then tap on the ‘Add friend’ symbol that appears toward the top under the right side.
2. A box appears. Enter the discord username and the tag number.
3. Hit the send friend request button once the search result appears.
4. Your friend request will be sent. The friend would be visible in your friend's list once they have approved your friend request.

Once your friend is added, you can directly message them or call them.

### 2\. How to add friends on Discord Server

discord is all about stumbling upon like-minded people and growing your gaming group. Once you join a server, you are bound to make a lot of friends. And sometimes, you might want to add them to your friend's list so you can text them personally.

Follow these steps to add a friend that you met on the server.

1. Open your discord app.
2. Click open the server that you and your friend are a part of.
3. Open the list of channel users. The button for the list is located towards the top at the right corner.
4. Find your friend on the list. When you find your friend, tap on their profile.
5. Their profile will pop up. Click the ‘add friend’ button.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-from-server-on-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Your friend request will be delivered.
2. Once they approve, they will be a part of your friend list.

Likewise, you can build a community of your own by creating a new server. You can invite your friends or people that you met while playing games or obsessing over some fandom.

## Part 3: How to Find Someone and Add Friends on Discord Without Number

In case you have been using discord for a while, you might have realized that the only way to add friends is by username and the Discord tag number. However, there is a way to add friends without the tag. And here is how to do it –

1. Open the Discord app on your phone.
2. Tap those ‘three parallel lines’ buttons located on the top left.
3. Tap the Friends symbol that appears on the bottom tab.
4. Tap on the ‘Add Friends’ button and you will see two tabs: Username and Nearby Scan. Select the Nearby Scan option.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile without numbers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-on-discord-mobile-without-number.jpg)

1. Ask your friend to turn on the Nearby Scan mode on their phone too.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile with nearby scan feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-nearby-scan-discord.jpg)

1. When your friend gets detected, they appear on the radar.
2. Hit the ‘Send’ button to send a Friend Request.
3. Once they accept your request, they will make their way to your Friends List.

Note that this method only works on the mobile app (it doesn't matter if you have an Android phone or iPhone). You cannot perform this with a PC or laptop.

Further, you and your friend both must be on the Nearby Scan mode to connect with this feature. This method only works for connections that are within a 10-meter radius. So, if your pal is from a whole different continent, you will need a user tag to add them as friends.

If you and the person you want to add are on the same server, you can add them through the channel user lists, as we discussed above.

## Bonus: How to Add friends on Discord without user tag via an invitation link

On Discord channels, it always ‘the more, the merrier.’ And your server can be one lonely place without friends. Plus, adding friends via a server is a lot easier and needs fewer steps. Create a server and customize it according to your taste. Don’t forget to add bots for fun!

1. Open your discord, and head over to the server that you want to add friends to.
2. Right-click on the server title. A menu with several options will appear.
3. From that list, choose ‘invite friends’ and an invite link will appear on the pop-up menu.

![add friends to Discord Server via invitation links](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-to-discord-server-via-invitation-link.jpg)

1. The invitation link typically expires in a day. But you can change this setting to ‘set this link to never expire.

![set Discord invitation links](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-discord-invitation-link.jpg)

1. Share this link with your friends over other social media apps to invite them.
2. Your friends will show up on the member list of your channel when they accept your invite and follow the link.
3. From here, you can right-click on the profile that you want to add as your Friend.
4. From the drop-down that appears, tap on the ‘Profile’ option.
5. The profile opens up. Here, click on the ‘send friend request’ option.

The person will receive the request. Upon approval, the friend will be added to your Friends list. This method does not require a user tag, and you can directly add your friends through the channel member's list.

This was a guide on **how to add friends in Discord** with user tags and from servers. You can view the sent and pending friend requests.

![ add friends on Discord server](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-on-discord-server.jpg)

1. View their profile. Click open the profile's menu.
2. Hit the Add Friend option and once the person accepts your request, you will find them in your friend list.

You can directly text or call the people who get added to your friend list.

Similarly, if a person (who’s not on your Friends List) has messaged you directly, you add them as a friend quickly.

To do this, open your chat list by clicking on your profile. Find the person you want to add to the chat list, and right-click on their profile. Tap the ‘Add Friend’ option. This is the fastest way to add friends on Discord without their user tag.

## Part 2: How to Add friends on Discord on Android and iOS?

The user interface of discord is more or less the same across various devices. The process of adding friends is quite similar to the one we discussed for the computer.

You cannot use discord over a phone's browser. To use discord on your phone, you have to download the app. It is available on Google Play Store and App Store. Once you have downloaded the app and logged in, here is **how to add people on Discord**.

### 1\. How to Add friends directly on Discord Mobile

If you have some friends that you do not share common channels with, you can add them directly with their username and Discord tag. Make sure you note down their user name and tag.

1. Open the discord app.
2. Tap on the Friends button that is located towards the bottom.

![ add friends on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friend-on-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Then tap on the ‘Add friend’ symbol that appears toward the top under the right side.
2. A box appears. Enter the discord username and the tag number.
3. Hit the send friend request button once the search result appears.
4. Your friend request will be sent. The friend would be visible in your friend's list once they have approved your friend request.

Once your friend is added, you can directly message them or call them.

### 2\. How to add friends on Discord Server

discord is all about stumbling upon like-minded people and growing your gaming group. Once you join a server, you are bound to make a lot of friends. And sometimes, you might want to add them to your friend's list so you can text them personally.

Follow these steps to add a friend that you met on the server.

1. Open your discord app.
2. Click open the server that you and your friend are a part of.
3. Open the list of channel users. The button for the list is located towards the top at the right corner.
4. Find your friend on the list. When you find your friend, tap on their profile.
5. Their profile will pop up. Click the ‘add friend’ button.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-from-server-on-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Your friend request will be delivered.
2. Once they approve, they will be a part of your friend list.

Likewise, you can build a community of your own by creating a new server. You can invite your friends or people that you met while playing games or obsessing over some fandom.

## Part 3: How to Find Someone and Add Friends on Discord Without Number

In case you have been using discord for a while, you might have realized that the only way to add friends is by username and the Discord tag number. However, there is a way to add friends without the tag. And here is how to do it –

1. Open the Discord app on your phone.
2. Tap those ‘three parallel lines’ buttons located on the top left.
3. Tap the Friends symbol that appears on the bottom tab.
4. Tap on the ‘Add Friends’ button and you will see two tabs: Username and Nearby Scan. Select the Nearby Scan option.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile without numbers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-on-discord-mobile-without-number.jpg)

1. Ask your friend to turn on the Nearby Scan mode on their phone too.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile with nearby scan feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-nearby-scan-discord.jpg)

1. When your friend gets detected, they appear on the radar.
2. Hit the ‘Send’ button to send a Friend Request.
3. Once they accept your request, they will make their way to your Friends List.

Note that this method only works on the mobile app (it doesn't matter if you have an Android phone or iPhone). You cannot perform this with a PC or laptop.

Further, you and your friend both must be on the Nearby Scan mode to connect with this feature. This method only works for connections that are within a 10-meter radius. So, if your pal is from a whole different continent, you will need a user tag to add them as friends.

If you and the person you want to add are on the same server, you can add them through the channel user lists, as we discussed above.

## Bonus: How to Add friends on Discord without user tag via an invitation link

On Discord channels, it always ‘the more, the merrier.’ And your server can be one lonely place without friends. Plus, adding friends via a server is a lot easier and needs fewer steps. Create a server and customize it according to your taste. Don’t forget to add bots for fun!

1. Open your discord, and head over to the server that you want to add friends to.
2. Right-click on the server title. A menu with several options will appear.
3. From that list, choose ‘invite friends’ and an invite link will appear on the pop-up menu.

![add friends to Discord Server via invitation links](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-to-discord-server-via-invitation-link.jpg)

1. The invitation link typically expires in a day. But you can change this setting to ‘set this link to never expire.

![set Discord invitation links](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-discord-invitation-link.jpg)

1. Share this link with your friends over other social media apps to invite them.
2. Your friends will show up on the member list of your channel when they accept your invite and follow the link.
3. From here, you can right-click on the profile that you want to add as your Friend.
4. From the drop-down that appears, tap on the ‘Profile’ option.
5. The profile opens up. Here, click on the ‘send friend request’ option.

The person will receive the request. Upon approval, the friend will be added to your Friends list. This method does not require a user tag, and you can directly add your friends through the channel member's list.

This was a guide on **how to add friends in Discord** with user tags and from servers. You can view the sent and pending friend requests.

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

From Facebook to even WhatsApp and Telegram, plain texts have become boring. Sticker fights on WhatsApp will give you an idea of how popular stickers are. Stickers are the new trend, and Discord just cannot lag behind in the race. Considering this, Discord is about to launch some lively, animated stickers.

#### In this article

* [**Part 2: How to Find Sticker Shop and Get Discord Stickers for Free?**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: How to Buy Discord Stickers?**](#part3)
* [**Part 4: How to Buy or Redeem a Discord Sticker Pack**](#part4)
* [**Part 5: How to Use Stickers on Discord?**](#part5)

## Part 1: What’s Discord Sticker?

Discord Sticker supports sending emojis and GIFs on chats. The stickers have been soft-launched in Japan, Canada, and Brazil. After testing and feedback, they will be available across the globe.

Luckily, if you are a Nitro user, you can access the stickers for free. These stickers are bundled in the Nitro subscription, and you can claim the cool new stickers for free. Just go to the sticker shop, and tap on the "Free" button to start using them.

For those of you who have a $4.99 subscription, you can get the What's Up Wumpus sticker pack for free. $9.99 subscription holders can unlock the What's Up Wumpus sticker pack and can use the Wumpus Nitro Elite pack as long as their subscription is active.

The $9.99 subscribers can also avail of a 33% discount on other **Discord sticker packs**. Once you purchase these stickers, they are a permanent part of your Discord inventory. Other than these, the shop has Doggo Replies, Nelly At Work, and Hello Wumpus stickers as default sticker packs.

After the soft launch, the Sticker Shop is available for the users across all the platforms – Android, iOS, and even on the desktop app and browser.

## Part 2: How to Find Sticker Shop and Get Discord Stickers for Free?

### \- On Phone

If you are lucky enough to be in Brazil, Japan, or Canada, you can access the Sticker Shop. You can tap on the emoji icon (the one that appears on the text box). The box that opens shows the emoji, and GIF tabs along with the sticker tab.

Tap on the sticker tab. A 'shop' symbol pops up towards the bottom (right hand). Tap on the symbol to open the sticker gallery. Here, you will see all the available sticker packs.

### \- Desktop (Browser)

![Discord Sticker Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-stickers-options.jpg)

If you use Discord on your desktop or browser, you can see the sticker icon right on the text bar. Tap on it, and then click on the shopping icon that appears towards the bottom (left corner). In the shop, you can browse through the sticker packs.

![Discord Stickers Browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/browser-and-buy-discord-sticker.jpg)

Nitro users will get the What's Up Wumpus stickers for free. However, they will have to buy other packs. The $9.99 Nitro users will get a 33% discount on sticker packs.

For now, the stickers can be used only by users in Japan, Brazil, and Canada. These users can send stickers to users in other countries. However, the receivers can see the stickers but cannot buy or send them.

However, you can try and use a VPN proxy to gain early access to it.

## Part 3: How to Buy Discord Stickers?

As we described above, you can access the sticker shop on your phone as well as desktop. Once in the shop, you can browse and pick the stickers to buy.

Before buying, you can view the stickers in the sticker pack. As a sample, you will be shown a few stickers. You can view the entire pack by tapping on the 'View All' tab.

## Part 4: How to Buy or Redeem a Discord Sticker Pack

Here is a brief rundown of the steps to follow if you want to buy a sticker pack.

* Choose a sticker pack that you like. View all the stickers to see what the pack looks like.
* Tap on the purchase button that is located right beside the name of the pack.
* You will be prompted to input your payment details. If you have saved a payment option on Discord, you can choose the relevant option.
* Agree to the Terms and Services of Discord.
* Finally, hit the purchase tab.
* The sticker pack is added to the inventory instantly.
* You can start sending them in the texts.

Note that Discord does not refund the money that is once paid. So, you cannot return the stickers to get a refund.

Another interesting thing to note is that the Sticker Shop refreshes and offers new sticker packs. Due to this rotation, a pack that is available in the shop today may be replaced by a new one tomorrow.

But don't worry. A timer displayed at the top left corner (besides the title) lets you know for how long the pack is available in the shop. You can grab it before the time runs out.

![Discord Stickers remaining days](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remaining-days-fordiscord-sticker.jpg)

## Part 5: How to Use Stickers on Discord?

Buying stickers is useless if you don't send them over texts. So, once you purchase stickers, you can immediately start sending them to your servers and texts.

### 1\. Sending Stickers on Discord Mobile App

![ send Discord Stickers on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sending-stickers-discord-mobile.jpg)

If you have the Discord app on your phone, tap on the emoji button. The Stickers tab appears, and this menu enables you to send the most-used stickers quickly, view all the purchased stickers, and search for appropriate stickers.

You can type an expression or emoji in the ‘Find the perfect sticker’ bar to find the right sticker. Hit the send button once you find the apt sticker.

### 2\. Sending Stickers from Discord Desktop (and over Browser)

![send Discord Stickers online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/send-sticker-discord-desktop-online.jpg)

Sending stickers on a desktop or browser is quite similar to the mobile process. On the chatbox, you will find the sticker icon. Tap on it to view your purchased sticker packs.

Once opened, the menu will show you the most-used stickers. You can view other packs and switch between them. You can also search for particular stickers by typing the terms on the search bar.

You can tap on a sticker to send it on chats and servers.

## Bonus: Adding Face-tracking AR Stickers to Video with [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

In the latest version of Wondershare Filmora (V10.5 and later version), you can add face-tracking AR stickers to people in the video, and light up the celebration with flashy and cute characters and elements. Here are some brief steps to add AR stickers to your video in Filmora.

### Step 1\. Download and install the latest version of Filmora

Click the button below to download and install the latest version of Filmora. If you have installed Filmora already, click the **About** option under the **Help** menu to check the version of Filmora.

[![Download Filmora  Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora   Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Note: You need to run Filmora 10.5 and later versions to add the AR stickers.

### Step 2\. Drag and drop your video footage to timeline

After launching Filmora, you need to import the video footage to the video editor. You can drag and drop the video footage to the timeline directly if you are working on a simple video project.

However, if you are working on a video project with many footages, it is recommended to upload them to the media library in order.

### Step 3\. Add AR Stickers to the video

After trimming or cutting out unnecessary frames from the video, you can now add the AR stickers to the footage. Go to the Effects tab and then scroll down to the **AR Sticker** directory.

![ Filmora AR Stickers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ar-sticker-directory.jpg)

Currently, there are 40 stickers available in Filmora. You can click each one to preview and download. To add a sticker to the video, you can drag and drop it to the video track above or to the video clip directly. You can add several stickers at the same time by placing them in the tracks accordingly.

![ Filmora AR Stickers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-multiple-ar-stickers-video.jpg)

### Step 4\. Preview and Export

After finishing the editing, you can click the play button in the preview window to preview, and then click the **Export** button to save the video.

## FAQs about Discord Sticker

And here we will answer some stuff that you might wonder about.

1. **What’s the difference between Discord Sticker and [Discord Emoji](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)?**

Well, emojis are emojis, and they are even in-built into your Android (or Google) and other keyboards on your phone. Emojis are not animated, and you can send basic Smiley or Sad faces (of course, there are animals and flowers, too). On the other hand, stickers are animated, and there can be specific sticker characters like What's Up Wumpus.

1. **Why can't I see the Sticker option on my Discord app?**

You cannot access the stickers on Discord probably because the feature has not been launched in your country yet. Stickers are only available for users in Brazil, Japan, and Canada. They will be launched in other countries after testing and feedback.

1. **Is Discord sticker free?**

If you are a Nitro subscriber, you will get the What’s Up Wumpus sticker pack for free. You will have to buy the other packs. As a $9.99 Nitro subscriber, you can get other packs at a 33% discount.

1. **Can I keep the purchased sticker pack forever in my account?**

Yes, once you buy a pack, you will have lifetime access to it. However, if you delete your Discord account, you will not get your stickers back. Further, packs like ‘Wumpus Nitro Elite’ can be accessed only on an active $9.99 subscription.

1. **Can people who are outside of Brazil, Canada, and Japan receive the stickers I sent?**

Yes, users from countries other than Japan, Canada, and Brazil can see the stickers in the chat sent to them. However, they could not buy or send them.

1. **Why my Discord sticker is not moving/animating?**

The stickers should move by default when sent. You can check if your sticker inventory is set to the smallest size. You can also go to User Settings, tap on Text & Images, and select Stickers. Adjust the settings appropriately. You can contact the Discord support team should you need further assistance.

Be patient until the cool update rolls out worldwide!

If you are lucky enough to be in Brazil, Japan, or Canada, you can access the Sticker Shop. You can tap on the emoji icon (the one that appears on the text box). The box that opens shows the emoji, and GIF tabs along with the sticker tab.

Tap on the sticker tab. A 'shop' symbol pops up towards the bottom (right hand). Tap on the symbol to open the sticker gallery. Here, you will see all the available sticker packs.

### \- Desktop (Browser)

![Discord Sticker Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-stickers-options.jpg)

If you use Discord on your desktop or browser, you can see the sticker icon right on the text bar. Tap on it, and then click on the shopping icon that appears towards the bottom (left corner). In the shop, you can browse through the sticker packs.

![Discord Stickers Browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/browser-and-buy-discord-sticker.jpg)

Nitro users will get the What's Up Wumpus stickers for free. However, they will have to buy other packs. The $9.99 Nitro users will get a 33% discount on sticker packs.

For now, the stickers can be used only by users in Japan, Brazil, and Canada. These users can send stickers to users in other countries. However, the receivers can see the stickers but cannot buy or send them.

However, you can try and use a VPN proxy to gain early access to it.

## Part 3: How to Buy Discord Stickers?

As we described above, you can access the sticker shop on your phone as well as desktop. Once in the shop, you can browse and pick the stickers to buy.

Before buying, you can view the stickers in the sticker pack. As a sample, you will be shown a few stickers. You can view the entire pack by tapping on the 'View All' tab.

## Part 4: How to Buy or Redeem a Discord Sticker Pack

Here is a brief rundown of the steps to follow if you want to buy a sticker pack.

* Choose a sticker pack that you like. View all the stickers to see what the pack looks like.
* Tap on the purchase button that is located right beside the name of the pack.
* You will be prompted to input your payment details. If you have saved a payment option on Discord, you can choose the relevant option.
* Agree to the Terms and Services of Discord.
* Finally, hit the purchase tab.
* The sticker pack is added to the inventory instantly.
* You can start sending them in the texts.

Note that Discord does not refund the money that is once paid. So, you cannot return the stickers to get a refund.

Another interesting thing to note is that the Sticker Shop refreshes and offers new sticker packs. Due to this rotation, a pack that is available in the shop today may be replaced by a new one tomorrow.

But don't worry. A timer displayed at the top left corner (besides the title) lets you know for how long the pack is available in the shop. You can grab it before the time runs out.

## Part 5: How to Use Stickers on Discord?

Buying stickers is useless if you don't send them over texts. So, once you purchase stickers, you can immediately start sending them to your servers and texts.

### 1\. Sending Stickers on Discord Mobile App

![ send Discord Stickers on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sending-stickers-discord-mobile.jpg)

If you have the Discord app on your phone, tap on the emoji button. The Stickers tab appears, and this menu enables you to send the most-used stickers quickly, view all the purchased stickers, and search for appropriate stickers.

You can type an expression or emoji in the ‘Find the perfect sticker’ bar to find the right sticker. Hit the send button once you find the apt sticker.

### 2\. Sending Stickers from Discord Desktop (and over Browser)

![send Discord Stickers online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/send-sticker-discord-desktop-online.jpg)

Sending stickers on a desktop or browser is quite similar to the mobile process. On the chatbox, you will find the sticker icon. Tap on it to view your purchased sticker packs.

Once opened, the menu will show you the most-used stickers. You can view other packs and switch between them. You can also search for particular stickers by typing the terms on the search bar.

You can tap on a sticker to send it on chats and servers.

## Bonus: Adding Face-tracking AR Stickers to Video with [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

In the latest version of Wondershare Filmora (V10.5 and later version), you can add face-tracking AR stickers to people in the video, and light up the celebration with flashy and cute characters and elements. Here are some brief steps to add AR stickers to your video in Filmora.

### Step 1\. Download and install the latest version of Filmora

Click the button below to download and install the latest version of Filmora. If you have installed Filmora already, click the **About** option under the **Help** menu to check the version of Filmora.

[![Download Filmora  Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora   Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Note: You need to run Filmora 10.5 and later versions to add the AR stickers.

### Step 2\. Drag and drop your video footage to timeline

After launching Filmora, you need to import the video footage to the video editor. You can drag and drop the video footage to the timeline directly if you are working on a simple video project.

However, if you are working on a video project with many footages, it is recommended to upload them to the media library in order.

### Step 3\. Add AR Stickers to the video

After trimming or cutting out unnecessary frames from the video, you can now add the AR stickers to the footage. Go to the Effects tab and then scroll down to the **AR Sticker** directory.

![ Filmora AR Stickers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ar-sticker-directory.jpg)

Currently, there are 40 stickers available in Filmora. You can click each one to preview and download. To add a sticker to the video, you can drag and drop it to the video track above or to the video clip directly. You can add several stickers at the same time by placing them in the tracks accordingly.

### Step 4\. Preview and Export

After finishing the editing, you can click the play button in the preview window to preview, and then click the **Export** button to save the video.

## FAQs about Discord Sticker

And here we will answer some stuff that you might wonder about.

1. **What’s the difference between Discord Sticker and [Discord Emoji](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)?**

Well, emojis are emojis, and they are even in-built into your Android (or Google) and other keyboards on your phone. Emojis are not animated, and you can send basic Smiley or Sad faces (of course, there are animals and flowers, too). On the other hand, stickers are animated, and there can be specific sticker characters like What's Up Wumpus.

1. **Why can't I see the Sticker option on my Discord app?**

You cannot access the stickers on Discord probably because the feature has not been launched in your country yet. Stickers are only available for users in Brazil, Japan, and Canada. They will be launched in other countries after testing and feedback.

1. **Is Discord sticker free?**

If you are a Nitro subscriber, you will get the What’s Up Wumpus sticker pack for free. You will have to buy the other packs. As a $9.99 Nitro subscriber, you can get other packs at a 33% discount.

1. **Can I keep the purchased sticker pack forever in my account?**

Yes, once you buy a pack, you will have lifetime access to it. However, if you delete your Discord account, you will not get your stickers back. Further, packs like ‘Wumpus Nitro Elite’ can be accessed only on an active $9.99 subscription.

1. **Can people who are outside of Brazil, Canada, and Japan receive the stickers I sent?**

Yes, users from countries other than Japan, Canada, and Brazil can see the stickers in the chat sent to them. However, they could not buy or send them.

1. **Why my Discord sticker is not moving/animating?**

The stickers should move by default when sent. You can check if your sticker inventory is set to the smallest size. You can also go to User Settings, tap on Text & Images, and select Stickers. Adjust the settings appropriately. You can contact the Discord support team should you need further assistance.

Be patient until the cool update rolls out worldwide!

Stickers are the new trend, and Discord just cannot lag behind in the race. Considering this, Discord is about to launch some lively, animated stickers.

## Part 1: What’s Discord Sticker?

Discord Sticker supports sending emojis and GIFs on chats. The stickers have been soft-launched in Japan, Canada, and Brazil. After testing and feedback, they will be available across the globe.

For those of you who have a $4.99 subscription, you can get the What's Up Wumpus sticker pack for free. $9.99 subscription holders can unlock the What's Up Wumpus sticker pack and can use the Wumpus Nitro Elite pack as long as their subscription is active.

The $9.99 subscribers can also avail of a 33% discount on other **Discord sticker packs**. Once you purchase these stickers, they are a permanent part of your Discord inventory. Other than these, the shop has Doggo Replies, Nelly At Work, and Hello Wumpus stickers as default sticker packs.

After the soft launch, the Sticker Shop is available for the users across all the platforms – Android, iOS, and even on the desktop app and browser.
