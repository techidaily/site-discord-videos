## Mastering Mass Message Deletion on Discord

# How To Delete Messages On Discord \[2024 Updated\]

Discord allows users to hold onto their message history forever, storing billions of messages in a blog post. And unlike other apps, Discord does not allow users to mass-delete their message history. For some, that can sound like a nightmare because of privacy and security reasons. You will have to wade through every message, deleting each of them, one by one.

However, if you find yourself in that position, fret not because there are several solutions to help you get around this limitation. Unfortunately, none of them are perfect.

Since there is no official method of mass deleting messages, these workarounds are shoddy, but until Discord offers an official solution, we'll have to do with them.

If you're looking to mass-delete your messages from a server or channel on Discord, here's how you will go about it for the desktop and mobile versions:

* [**Part 2: How to Delete Direct Messages on Discord**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: Deleting Channel Messages in Discord**](#part3)
* [**Part 4: Deleting Messages with Discord Clear Chat Bot**](#part4)
* [**Part 5: Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord**](#part5)

## Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types

In Discord, you will see two types of messages: Direct Messages and Channel Messages in servers. Here are the differences between the two:

* **Direct Messages**: These messages are private and held between two users
* **Channel Messages**: These messages are sent in a channel or a specific group

Both of these message types abide by different rules and functions. In the early days of Discord, users had the luxury of deleting messages in bulk.

However, this was soon changed because the mass execution directly affected the app's database. Since then, the application has adopted specific rules regarding message deletion.

## Part 2: How to Delete Direct Messages on Discord

If you use Discord on your desktop computer, this section will discuss the steps to follow to delete your direct messages.

However, keep in mind that Discord does not allow you to delete direct messages. If you don't want to show messages from a particular friend, you can remove the chat copy, and it will disappear from the messages temporarily, although it will still be visible in the recipient's chats. And if the friend contacts you again, the messages will show.

![Remove Discord Direct Message Copy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-discord-copy.jpg)

You can delete the local copy of messages by following the steps below:

1. Open the Discord program on your computer and go to the chat panel of the person whom you direct messaged;
2. Tap on the 'Message' option on the left side, and then select the 'Direct Message' option on the top left side;
3. Select the message that you want to delete and click the 3 dots to click on Delete Message, then the message you sent will be deleted at your end.

![ delete Discord Message  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-discord-direct-message.jpg)

The procedure for deleting DMs from your Discord smartphone application applies for both the Android and IOS application, and it is as follows:

1. Open the Discord app on your smartphone
2. Find the message that you want to delete
3. Tap and hold the message. You will be presented with a list
4. Tap 'Delete' on that list
5. Confirm your decision by tapping 'Delete' once again
6. The message will be deleted

## Part 3: How to Delete Channel Messages in Discord?

This method has to be the most effective and easy way to delete a Discord message, and it's a simple, straightforward procedure:

1. Go to the message and glide over it to reveal the three-tier settings icon
2. Click on it to show options, and then select Delete Message

To do this individually, you will need to use the mouse consistently, eating up a lot of time. If you wish to do it by keyboard, you can do so, provided you know the sequence for the keyboard commands for deletion.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the sequence:

1. Select the Chat panel that you want to delete
2. Hover your cursor over the messages you wish to delete
3. A three-dot icon will appear on the right side of the message
4. Click on the icon, and a pop-menu will show
5. On the pop-up menu, select 'Delete'
6. You will be prompted with a confirmation for deleting the message
7. Tick the confirmation and tap the 'Delete' button
8. Your message will be deleted

At first glance, it seems like a long and tedious process, but once you get down to doing it and develop a rhythm, it is an easy task.

## Part 4: Deleting Message with Discord Clear Chat Bot

Please keep in mind that Discord has changed its policy regarding bots, going from discouraging their use to outright flagging them as a violation of its terms.

Using bots can put you at risk of termination from the app, so we would not advise you to adopt this method, and if you do, please tread with caution.

With that said, many users report that using self-bots does not significantly lead to any disciplinary action from Discord, given that the reason for use is not harmful or disruptive.

Discord requires that all bots are tracked through its 'Develop Portal.' Self-bots run on a Discord API token and can circumvent this rule, allowing them access to API requests hence automating many tasks, such as deleting messages.

The Discord API supports a POST request, letting bots swiftly discard messages less than fourteen days old. Messages that are older than this timeframe can be queued and discarded one-by-one.

One particular bot that is of interest to us is the MEE6\. It is used to control moderation, set-up leveling, manage music, and much more, including mass-deleting messages on Discord.

We've outlined a few commands you can use to delete your chats. These are as follows:

1. Go to the official MEE6 website and click on the button that says Add to Discord

![delete messages on discord with mee6 bot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-bot-mee6.jpg)

1. You'll be prompted to authorize so that MEE6 bot can access your username, and know what server you’re in.
2. Pin-point the server you want to add the bot and then set up to connect MEE6 to the Discord server.

![how to delete discord message with mee6 bot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-server-to-add-mee6-bot-discord.jpg)

1. Click Authorize again and the bot will be added to your Discord server soon;
2. To enable MEE6 to clear the chat, you should enable the Moderator plugin first. Click the Moderator option under Plugins first, and then click Yes.

![remove discord message with mee 6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mee6-moderator-plugin-moderator.jpg)

1. Now go to the server in your Discord and type in “!clear @username” to remove every message sent by the user you've mentioned.

![delete discord channel message with MEE6 Bot  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-channel-message-in-bulk-mee6-discord.jpg)

To clear the last 100 messages on your server, type in “!clear 100”. You can replace 100 with any number of your choice. However, MEE6 can’t delete messages past 2 weeks.

## Part 5: How to Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord?

In the section above, we talked about deleting messages without using the mouse. That leads us to the possibility of utilizing the 'AutoHotkey' script to automate the process.

Most developers have come up with codes that can delete Discord messages from your account on a mass scale. We'll be expanding on one of the most popular instances of this: the AutoHotkey script.

Before you get started with this, you will need an 'AutoHotkey installer.' Continue the process by:

1. Download and install the 'AutoHotkey installer' ;
2. Head onto your desktop, right-click and click 'New' on the drop-down menu;
3. Choose the 'AutoHotkey script' and right-click on this file and edit with 'Notepad'
4. Delete everything in the script and paste the following code

**_t::_**

**_Loop, 100000_**

**_{_**

**_send, {Up}_**

**_send, ^a_**

**_send, {BS}_**

**_send, {Enter}_**

**_send, {Enter}_**

**_sleep, 100_**

**_}_**

**_Return_**

1. Save the file as any name that you wish to
2. Once you've done that, launch Discord and double-click on the script file
3. Open the chat data that you wish to delete and press T
4. The script will now delete all the messages

To stop the script, click on the H icon located on the right side of your taskbar and select Pause Script.

This is the process by which you can use an 'Autohotkey script' to delete messages in bulk. Please note that this option is only available to Windows users as AutoHotkey does not currently work on macOS.

Ideally, you'll want the following things from your AutoHotkey script:

1. A toggle key for turning it on and off
2. The complete keyboard sequence with stops between each step

**Disclaimer**: you can delete a message you sent, but there's no saying if the other person took a screenshot before you got around to deleting it. Things on the internet tend to stick around. So, as a safe bet, it's a good idea to take some time to consider what you wrote before pressing send to avoid any regrets.

## FAQs About Deleting Discord Messages

#### 1\. Can I Recover A Deleted Message on Discord?

Unfortunately, once a message is deleted, there is no way for Discord users to reaccess it.

#### 2\. Can I View Deleted Messages?

Unfortunately, there is no way to see deleted messages. Channel and server admins can see if a message was deleted, but they cannot see the deleted message's contents.

#### 3\. How Can I Delete Other People's Messages?

If you are an admin or an owner of a server, you can delete other people's messages by following one of the methods mentioned above.

We've outlined a few commands you can use to delete your chats. These are as follows:

1. Go to the official MEE6 website and click on the button that says Add to Discord

![delete messages on discord with mee6 bot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-bot-mee6.jpg)

1. You'll be prompted to authorize so that MEE6 bot can access your username, and know what server you’re in.
2. Pin-point the server you want to add the bot and then set up to connect MEE6 to the Discord server.

![how to delete discord message with mee6 bot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-server-to-add-mee6-bot-discord.jpg)

1. Click Authorize again and the bot will be added to your Discord server soon;
2. To enable MEE6 to clear the chat, you should enable the Moderator plugin first. Click the Moderator option under Plugins first, and then click Yes.

![remove discord message with mee 6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mee6-moderator-plugin-moderator.jpg)

1. Now go to the server in your Discord and type in “!clear @username” to remove every message sent by the user you've mentioned.

![delete discord channel message with MEE6 Bot  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-channel-message-in-bulk-mee6-discord.jpg)

To clear the last 100 messages on your server, type in “!clear 100”. You can replace 100 with any number of your choice. However, MEE6 can’t delete messages past 2 weeks.

## Part 5: How to Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord?

In the section above, we talked about deleting messages without using the mouse. That leads us to the possibility of utilizing the 'AutoHotkey' script to automate the process.

Most developers have come up with codes that can delete Discord messages from your account on a mass scale. We'll be expanding on one of the most popular instances of this: the AutoHotkey script.

Before you get started with this, you will need an 'AutoHotkey installer.' Continue the process by:

1. Download and install the 'AutoHotkey installer' ;
2. Head onto your desktop, right-click and click 'New' on the drop-down menu;
3. Choose the 'AutoHotkey script' and right-click on this file and edit with 'Notepad'
4. Delete everything in the script and paste the following code

**_t::_**

**_Loop, 100000_**

**_{_**

**_send, {Up}_**

**_send, ^a_**

**_send, {BS}_**

**_send, {Enter}_**

**_send, {Enter}_**

**_sleep, 100_**

**_}_**

**_Return_**

1. Save the file as any name that you wish to
2. Once you've done that, launch Discord and double-click on the script file
3. Open the chat data that you wish to delete and press T
4. The script will now delete all the messages

To stop the script, click on the H icon located on the right side of your taskbar and select Pause Script.

This is the process by which you can use an 'Autohotkey script' to delete messages in bulk. Please note that this option is only available to Windows users as AutoHotkey does not currently work on macOS.

Ideally, you'll want the following things from your AutoHotkey script:

1. A toggle key for turning it on and off
2. The complete keyboard sequence with stops between each step

**Disclaimer**: you can delete a message you sent, but there's no saying if the other person took a screenshot before you got around to deleting it. Things on the internet tend to stick around. So, as a safe bet, it's a good idea to take some time to consider what you wrote before pressing send to avoid any regrets.

Discord allows users to hold onto their message history forever, storing billions of messages in a blog post. And unlike other apps, Discord does not allow users to mass-delete their message history. For some, that can sound like a nightmare because of privacy and security reasons. You will have to wade through every message, deleting each of them, one by one.

However, if you find yourself in that position, fret not because there are several solutions to help you get around this limitation. Unfortunately, none of them are perfect.

Since there is no official method of mass deleting messages, these workarounds are shoddy, but until Discord offers an official solution, we'll have to do with them.

If you're looking to mass-delete your messages from a server or channel on Discord, here's how you will go about it for the desktop and mobile versions:

* [**Part 2: How to Delete Direct Messages on Discord**](#part2)

* [**Part 4: Deleting Messages with Discord Clear Chat Bot**](#part4)
* [**Part 5: Clear All Chats and Delete All Messages In Discord**](#part5)

## Part 1: Understanding Discord Message Types

In Discord, you will see two types of messages: Direct Messages and Channel Messages in servers. Here are the differences between the two:

* **Direct Messages**: These messages are private and held between two users
* **Channel Messages**: These messages are sent in a channel or a specific group

Both of these message types abide by different rules and functions. In the early days of Discord, users had the luxury of deleting messages in bulk.

However, this was soon changed because the mass execution directly affected the app's database. Since then, the application has adopted specific rules regarding message deletion.

## Part 2: How to Delete Direct Messages on Discord

If you use Discord on your desktop computer, this section will discuss the steps to follow to delete your direct messages.

However, keep in mind that Discord does not allow you to delete direct messages. If you don't want to show messages from a particular friend, you can remove the chat copy, and it will disappear from the messages temporarily, although it will still be visible in the recipient's chats. And if the friend contacts you again, the messages will show.

![Remove Discord Direct Message Copy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-discord-copy.jpg)

You can delete the local copy of messages by following the steps below:

1. Open the Discord program on your computer and go to the chat panel of the person whom you direct messaged;
2. Tap on the 'Message' option on the left side, and then select the 'Direct Message' option on the top left side;
3. Select the message that you want to delete and click the 3 dots to click on Delete Message, then the message you sent will be deleted at your end.

![ delete Discord Message  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-discord-direct-message.jpg)

The procedure for deleting DMs from your Discord smartphone application applies for both the Android and IOS application, and it is as follows:

1. Open the Discord app on your smartphone
2. Find the message that you want to delete
3. Tap and hold the message. You will be presented with a list
4. Tap 'Delete' on that list
5. Confirm your decision by tapping 'Delete' once again
6. The message will be deleted

## Part 3: How to Delete Channel Messages in Discord?

This method has to be the most effective and easy way to delete a Discord message, and it's a simple, straightforward procedure:

1. Go to the message and glide over it to reveal the three-tier settings icon
2. Click on it to show options, and then select Delete Message

To do this individually, you will need to use the mouse consistently, eating up a lot of time. If you wish to do it by keyboard, you can do so, provided you know the sequence for the keyboard commands for deletion.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the sequence:

1. Select the Chat panel that you want to delete
2. Hover your cursor over the messages you wish to delete
3. A three-dot icon will appear on the right side of the message
4. Click on the icon, and a pop-menu will show
5. On the pop-up menu, select 'Delete'
6. You will be prompted with a confirmation for deleting the message
7. Tick the confirmation and tap the 'Delete' button
8. Your message will be deleted

At first glance, it seems like a long and tedious process, but once you get down to doing it and develop a rhythm, it is an easy task.

## Part 4: Deleting Message with Discord Clear Chat Bot

Please keep in mind that Discord has changed its policy regarding bots, going from discouraging their use to outright flagging them as a violation of its terms.

Using bots can put you at risk of termination from the app, so we would not advise you to adopt this method, and if you do, please tread with caution.

With that said, many users report that using self-bots does not significantly lead to any disciplinary action from Discord, given that the reason for use is not harmful or disruptive.

Discord requires that all bots are tracked through its 'Develop Portal.' Self-bots run on a Discord API token and can circumvent this rule, allowing them access to API requests hence automating many tasks, such as deleting messages.

The Discord API supports a POST request, letting bots swiftly discard messages less than fourteen days old. Messages that are older than this timeframe can be queued and discarded one-by-one.

One particular bot that is of interest to us is the MEE6\. It is used to control moderation, set-up leveling, manage music, and much more, including mass-deleting messages on Discord.

We've outlined a few commands you can use to delete your chats. These are as follows:

1. You'll be prompted to authorize so that MEE6 bot can access your username, and know what server you’re in.
2. Pin-point the server you want to add the bot and then set up to connect MEE6 to the Discord server.

![how to delete discord message with mee6 bot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-server-to-add-mee6-bot-discord.jpg)

1. Click Authorize again and the bot will be added to your Discord server soon;
2. To enable MEE6 to clear the chat, you should enable the Moderator plugin first. Click the Moderator option under Plugins first, and then click Yes.

![remove discord message with mee 6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mee6-moderator-plugin-moderator.jpg)

1. Now go to the server in your Discord and type in “!clear @username” to remove every message sent by the user you've mentioned.

![delete discord channel message with MEE6 Bot  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-channel-message-in-bulk-mee6-discord.jpg)

To clear the last 100 messages on your server, type in “!clear 100”. You can replace 100 with any number of your choice. However, MEE6 can’t delete messages past 2 weeks.

## How to Find Discord Server

Discord started out as a place for Gamers to hang out and play together online. Soon, it became a popular chat forum for people who obsess over music, movies, art, and anime fans.

Initially, Discord served as a voice channel for Gamers. However, today it is much more than that. It has bots, streaming features, voice channels, and many more personalization tools that make your server an intimate Hangout.

Using Discord without joining a server is as good as not using Discord at all. But if you are a newbie, you might find it difficult to join a server with active users. Not all servers are good, and this guide will help you filter out the best servers on Discord.

## Part 1: How to Find Discord Server on Explore Public Servers tab

The obvious questions that you will encounter after signing up on Discord are - **How to find a Discord server**? Is it difficult? Do I have to fill up an application?

One of the popular and easiest ways to find servers is to use explore Public Servers function. Here is a brief rundown of the steps -

1. Open the Discord app on your desktop visit the site.
2. Tap the compass symbol to open the explore public service option.
1. You will be directed towards the official Discord server directory. It has a search box on the top. Many top servers are listed below. Popular games like Minecraft, Fortnite, Call of Duty, and more are listed. You can tap open any of these channels to explore the community.

![Find Discord Server   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-community-on-discord-explore-public-server.jpg)

1. Likewise, you can enter some search terms in a search box and explore the channels related to the term. For instance, you can input the term 'Disney Movies' or 'Call of Duty' and hit the search button. And a list of servers dedicated to the terms will appear.
2. After exploring Discord servers, you might stumble upon a channel that you like. All you have to do is tab the join button.
3. To return to the directory, tap the compass.
4. Another way to hunt for the right servers is to explore the categories in the left side menu. The most common categories listed are - Gaming, Entertainment, Music, Art, and a few more.

## Part 2: Finding best Discord Server via Online Discord Website Directories

Another quick and easy way to find legit Discord servers is to explore the online directories dedicated to Discord servers.

Some of the popular channel directories are -

1. [Discord.me](http://discord.me/)

![Find Discord Server  via Discord.me ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discordme-bot-find-server.jpg)

You will fall in love with the appearance and user interface of Discord.me. The directory offers more than a thousand Discord servers. And a good number of them are legit. The ‘Categories’ drop-down list has a huge number of categories that people generally look for. You can also look for random servers and bots. The huge search bar at the top helps you explore the channels related to your search queries. Just below the search bar, the top channel categories are listed. If you scroll even further down, top servers are displayed. You can even look at the ones that have seen a recent surge in members and the ones that have mature content.

1. [disboard.org](http://discord.org/)

![Find Discord Server via  disboard.org ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discover-discord-servers-disboard.jpg)

This is the biggest directory that features servers sprawl across various subjects like languages, music, politics, LGBTQ, and several more alongside the usual gaming channels. You can use the search bar to hunt for servers related to your tastes. If you are baffled about where to start, you can explore the categories and tags underneath the search bar.

If you keep scrolling, you will come across popular channels or channels that have witnessed a sudden spike. On the disboard site, you can also read reviews about servers before joining them. You can also sort the servers according to your location.

1. [Discordservers.com](http://discordservers.com/)

![Find Discord Server via  Discordservers.com ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-discord-server-via-discordservers-bot.jpg)

This directory houses a vast collection of servers that are dedicated gaming community and geekdom. Upon entering the site, you will immediately notice that it has a sleek and minimal interface. You can easily navigate and find what you are looking for. The landing page has a list of featured channels. On the top, there is a search bar that can assist you in finding the servers related to your interests. However, you can hit the ‘browse’ button beside the search bar to explore all the categories.

After exploring the servers, you can pick a handful and have a glance at the servers before you decide to join in. You can scroll endlessly until you find a suitable channel for yourself. You can join multiple channels too.

## Part 3: How to Find Private Discord Server

Along with Public Servers that can be joined just with a click, there are many private servers. These servers can be entered only by invitation. The server's creator can send the invitations to you, or you will find the links on Twitter, Facebook, or other platforms.

The obvious questions that you will encounter after signing up on Discord are - **How to find Discord server**? Is it difficult? Do I have to fill up an application?

Unlike public servers, private servers have 50 to 500 members. They are not as active as the open ones, but they might be more dedicated to a specific community. Open servers are often more active, but they are "general." In case you want a more personal space with a few people, you might consider joining a private server.

Looking for a private server is a lot easier on platforms like Reddit. Here, you may find a link that leads to a private server. When you click on it, you will be directed to a landing page. Once you tap on the 'Accept Invite,' you will get into the private server.

Some servers require you to follow certain guidelines. If you don't comply, you will get a warning message from the mod or the bot. In worse scenarios, you might be kicked out. Further, some channels will prompt you to text the mod before you are allowed to enter. This is **how to find a** **Discord server that is private**.

Further, you can create your own server and invite your friends or your gaming clan to it. A server can be a personal space where you can talk to your friends via voice channels, stream games together, chat, share memes, listen to music, and add bots!

## Part 4: Find Discord Servers to Join Via other Platforms

Like we discussed above, Reddit is one of the places to find private Discord servers. Similarly, pages and communities on Facebook, Twitch, YouTube, and others might also link out to their Discord servers.

Further, influencers, series, movies may have a dedicated Discord server. Even blogs and websites can have a channel for their followers. Several gaming companies have a Discord channel for sharing tips with fans and for updates.

Several game streamers that stream on Twitch or Mixer have their own server where they update their followers. If you follow them, you can join their channel. The same goes for YouTubers and other gamers. Even tech-geek blogs and vlogs have a Discord server.

At the same time, people interested in business, the stock market, and investment have channels of their own. You can even find servers made by some musicians, artists, manga fans, anime fans, and more such communities.

Whenever you visit your favorite site, blog, or YouTube channel the next time, look if they have a Discord channel!

Several game streamers that stream on Twitch or Mixer have their own server where they update their followers. If you follow them, you can join their channel. The same goes for YouTubers and other gamers. Even tech-geek blogs and vlogs have a Discord server.

At the same time, people interested in business, the stock market, and investment have channels of their own. You can even find servers made by some musicians, artists, manga fans, anime fans, and more such communities.

Whenever you visit your favorite site, blog, or YouTube channel the next time, look if they have a Discord channel!

## How to Find Discord Server

Discord started out as a place for Gamers to hang out and play together online. Soon, it became a popular chat forum for people who obsess over music, movies, art, and anime fans.

Initially, Discord served as a voice channel for Gamers. However, today it is much more than that. It has bots, streaming features, voice channels, and many more personalization tools that make your server an intimate Hangout.

Using Discord without joining a server is as good as not using Discord at all. But if you are a newbie, you might find it difficult to join a server with active users. Not all servers are good, and this guide will help you filter out the best servers on Discord.

## Part 1: How to Find Discord Server on Explore Public Servers tab

The obvious questions that you will encounter after signing up on Discord are - **How to find a Discord server**? Is it difficult? Do I have to fill up an application?

One of the popular and easiest ways to find servers is to use explore Public Servers function. Here is a brief rundown of the steps -

1. Open the Discord app on your desktop visit the site.
2. Tap the compass symbol to open the explore public service option.
1. You will be directed towards the official Discord server directory. It has a search box on the top. Many top servers are listed below. Popular games like Minecraft, Fortnite, Call of Duty, and more are listed. You can tap open any of these channels to explore the community.

![Find Discord Server   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-community-on-discord-explore-public-server.jpg)

1. Likewise, you can enter some search terms in a search box and explore the channels related to the term. For instance, you can input the term 'Disney Movies' or 'Call of Duty' and hit the search button. And a list of servers dedicated to the terms will appear.
2. After exploring Discord servers, you might stumble upon a channel that you like. All you have to do is tab the join button.
3. To return to the directory, tap the compass.
4. Another way to hunt for the right servers is to explore the categories in the left side menu. The most common categories listed are - Gaming, Entertainment, Music, Art, and a few more.

## Part 2: Finding best Discord Server via Online Discord Website Directories

Another quick and easy way to find legit Discord servers is to explore the online directories dedicated to Discord servers.

Some of the popular channel directories are -

1. [Discord.me](http://discord.me/)

![Find Discord Server  via Discord.me ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discordme-bot-find-server.jpg)

You will fall in love with the appearance and user interface of Discord.me. The directory offers more than a thousand Discord servers. And a good number of them are legit. The ‘Categories’ drop-down list has a huge number of categories that people generally look for. You can also look for random servers and bots. The huge search bar at the top helps you explore the channels related to your search queries. Just below the search bar, the top channel categories are listed. If you scroll even further down, top servers are displayed. You can even look at the ones that have seen a recent surge in members and the ones that have mature content.

1. [disboard.org](http://discord.org/)

![Find Discord Server via  disboard.org ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discover-discord-servers-disboard.jpg)

This is the biggest directory that features servers sprawl across various subjects like languages, music, politics, LGBTQ, and several more alongside the usual gaming channels. You can use the search bar to hunt for servers related to your tastes. If you are baffled about where to start, you can explore the categories and tags underneath the search bar.

If you keep scrolling, you will come across popular channels or channels that have witnessed a sudden spike. On the disboard site, you can also read reviews about servers before joining them. You can also sort the servers according to your location.

1. [Discordservers.com](http://discordservers.com/)

![Find Discord Server via  Discordservers.com ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-discord-server-via-discordservers-bot.jpg)

This directory houses a vast collection of servers that are dedicated gaming community and geekdom. Upon entering the site, you will immediately notice that it has a sleek and minimal interface. You can easily navigate and find what you are looking for. The landing page has a list of featured channels. On the top, there is a search bar that can assist you in finding the servers related to your interests. However, you can hit the ‘browse’ button beside the search bar to explore all the categories.

After exploring the servers, you can pick a handful and have a glance at the servers before you decide to join in. You can scroll endlessly until you find a suitable channel for yourself. You can join multiple channels too.

## Part 3: How to Find Private Discord Server

Along with Public Servers that can be joined just with a click, there are many private servers. These servers can be entered only by invitation. The server's creator can send the invitations to you, or you will find the links on Twitter, Facebook, or other platforms.

The obvious questions that you will encounter after signing up on Discord are - **How to find Discord server**? Is it difficult? Do I have to fill up an application?

Unlike public servers, private servers have 50 to 500 members. They are not as active as the open ones, but they might be more dedicated to a specific community. Open servers are often more active, but they are "general." In case you want a more personal space with a few people, you might consider joining a private server.

Looking for a private server is a lot easier on platforms like Reddit. Here, you may find a link that leads to a private server. When you click on it, you will be directed to a landing page. Once you tap on the 'Accept Invite,' you will get into the private server.

Some servers require you to follow certain guidelines. If you don't comply, you will get a warning message from the mod or the bot. In worse scenarios, you might be kicked out. Further, some channels will prompt you to text the mod before you are allowed to enter. This is **how to find a** **Discord server that is private**.

Further, you can create your own server and invite your friends or your gaming clan to it. A server can be a personal space where you can talk to your friends via voice channels, stream games together, chat, share memes, listen to music, and add bots!

## Part 4: Find Discord Servers to Join Via other Platforms

Like we discussed above, Reddit is one of the places to find private Discord servers. Similarly, pages and communities on Facebook, Twitch, YouTube, and others might also link out to their Discord servers.

Further, influencers, series, movies may have a dedicated Discord server. Even blogs and websites can have a channel for their followers. Several gaming companies have a Discord channel for sharing tips with fans and for updates.
