## Part 1: How To Use Voice Changer Voicemod For Discord On Desktop Computer

Voicemod is arguably one of the best voice changer tools available on the internet for its excellent features.

But before we jump straight into using Voicemod for Discord, you must know how to install one on your desktop Mac/PC.

### Here's how to install Voicemod

1. Visit the Voicemod website to begin the download process.
2. You'll see the button “Get Voicemod Free” on the screen. Click it!
3. Upon clicking, the site will ask you to sign in to your account from Discord, Twitch, to Google. Use your Discord login details to sign in.
4. After you're signed in, the “.exe” file will be downloaded to your PC/Mac's download folder. Open the “.exe” file the moment it's downloaded.
5. An install wizard will open up. Navigate through the wizard's installation process to install the program on your PC/Mac.
6. After installation is complete, the installation wizard will ask to restart your windows' Mac or PC.

You can skip it, but it's best to restart it for smooth operations.

Once your Mac/PC restarts, you'll see the Voicemod app icon on your desktop screen.

Now that you have successfully installed the voice changer Voicemod app into your desktop computer, let's dive into knowing **how to use Voicemod on Discord**!

### Here's how to use voice changer on Discord

1. Click the Vociemod icon on the desktop to open the app. If you can't find it there, click the “windows icon” located at the screen's bottom-left. Just type “Voicemod,” and the program will show up. Double click it to get it opened.
2. When the app opens up, you'll have to choose the output and input it will use. If you're wondering, why the output? This is to give you an insight into what your voice will sound like on each filter.

Once it's done, you can play around with different filters!

Every day, you'll get new free filters to use; however, to unlock and access all filters, you need to upgrade to the “pro-version” of voice changer Voicemod.

On the other hand, if you only need a few filters, the “basic-version” should suffice.

Apart from that, you can unlock an additional free filter in your app by sharing it on your social media accounts.

![Set up Voicemod for Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-voicemod-discord.jpg)

#### Step 1

To set up Voicemod with Discord, open your discord account and go to the settings (gear icon) placed at the screen's bottom-left corner.

#### Step 2

Click the “Voice and Video” option right under the app settings.

#### Step 3

To make Voicemod usable, you'll have to change Voice settings. Within the “Input Device” option, select the option that says “Microphone Voicemod Virtual Audio.”

#### Step 4

After you have changed settings, you can easily change the voice within the program. Not only this, but other users can also hear your audio alteration.

#### Step 5

With the “basic version,” you'll have seven free voice choices that will change each day. On the contrary, with the “pro-version,” you'll gain access to more than 80 different voice options.

So, if you're searching for an easy and simple voice-changing app to use, look no further than Voicemod!

## Part 2: How To Fix Voicemod Not Working Discord?

Is your voice changer Voicemod not working on Discord? No worries, you can troubleshoot the issues with a few basic steps.

Here are some ways you can use to fix Voicemod not working in Discord:

### Method 1: Restart Your Windows PC/Mac

Though it's not a technical solution, restarting your desktop computer fixes incorrect settings by rebooting them and solves many problems connected with your computer system, programs, and hardware.

So, when your Voicemod suddenly ceases to work in Discord, make sure to restart your Windows PC/Mac before going any further, as it's the first step in fixing voice issues.

If restarting doesn't help, slide to the next step!

### Method 2: Make Sure The Mic Is Properly Set

Just follow the steps below to resolve it:

1. On the keyboard, press the “Win” logo and the “I” key simultaneously to open Windows settings. Click “System.”
2. On the left, you'll see the option “Sound.” Click it.

2. Click “Device properties & test microphone”
3. Make sure to uncheck the “disable” box and keep the volume section 100
4. Click the “Start test” button and speak into the microphone
5. After that, click “Stop test.” If the greatest value it shows is above “0”, then your microphone works correctly

Now, restart your Voicemod app to see if it's working properly or not! If the issue still persists, jump to the next solution.

### Method 4:Re-Install Voice Changer Voicemod Drivers

But before we jump straight into using Voicemod for Discord, you must know how to install one on your desktop Mac/PC.

### Here's how to install Voicemod

1. Visit the Voicemod website to begin the download process.
2. You'll see the button “Get Voicemod Free” on the screen. Click it!
3. Upon clicking, the site will ask you to sign in to your account from Discord, Twitch, to Google. Use your Discord login details to sign in.
4. After you're signed in, the “.exe” file will be downloaded to your PC/Mac's download folder. Open the “.exe” file the moment it's downloaded.
5. An install wizard will open up. Navigate through the wizard's installation process to install the program on your PC/Mac.
6. After installation is complete, the installation wizard will ask to restart your windows' Mac or PC.

You can skip it, but it's best to restart it for smooth operations.

Once your Mac/PC restarts, you'll see the Voicemod app icon on your desktop screen.

Now that you have successfully installed the voice changer Voicemod app into your desktop computer, let's dive into knowing **how to use Voicemod on Discord**!

### Here's how to use voice changer on Discord

1. Click the Vociemod icon on the desktop to open the app. If you can't find it there, click the “windows icon” located at the screen's bottom-left. Just type “Voicemod,” and the program will show up. Double click it to get it opened.
2. When the app opens up, you'll have to choose the output and input it will use. If you're wondering, why the output? This is to give you an insight into what your voice will sound like on each filter.

Once it's done, you can play around with different filters!

Every day, you'll get new free filters to use; however, to unlock and access all filters, you need to upgrade to the “pro-version” of voice changer Voicemod.

On the other hand, if you only need a few filters, the “basic-version” should suffice.

Apart from that, you can unlock an additional free filter in your app by sharing it on your social media accounts.

#### Step 1

To set up Voicemod with Discord, open your discord account and go to the settings (gear icon) placed at the screen's bottom-left corner.

#### Step 2

Click the “Voice and Video” option right under the app settings.

#### Step 3

To make Voicemod usable, you'll have to change Voice settings. Within the “Input Device” option, select the option that says “Microphone Voicemod Virtual Audio.”

#### Step 4

After you have changed settings, you can easily change the voice within the program. Not only this, but other users can also hear your audio alteration.

#### Step 5

With the “basic version,” you'll have seven free voice choices that will change each day. On the contrary, with the “pro-version,” you'll gain access to more than 80 different voice options.

So, if you're searching for an easy and simple voice-changing app to use, look no further than Voicemod!

## Part 2: How To Fix Voicemod Not Working Discord?

Is your voice changer Voicemod not working on Discord? No worries, you can troubleshoot the issues with a few basic steps.

Here are some ways you can use to fix Voicemod not working in Discord:

### Method 1: Restart Your Windows PC/Mac

Though it's not a technical solution, restarting your desktop computer fixes incorrect settings by rebooting them and solves many problems connected with your computer system, programs, and hardware.

So, when your Voicemod suddenly ceases to work in Discord, make sure to restart your Windows PC/Mac before going any further, as it's the first step in fixing voice issues.

If restarting doesn't help, slide to the next step!

### Method 2: Make Sure The Mic Is Properly Set

The next step is to check if the mic works correctly. This is because faulty settings may stop voice changer Voicemod from operating correctly.

Just follow the steps below to resolve it:

1. On the keyboard, press the “Win” logo and the “I” key simultaneously to open Windows settings. Click “System.”
2. On the left, you'll see the option “Sound.” Click it.

![Set up Windows Sound for Voicemod](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-windows-sound.jpg)

1. First, you have to test the microphone! To do so, choose the “Headset” option rather than the Voicemod microphone under the “Input” section
2. Click “Device properties & test microphone”
3. Make sure to uncheck the “disable” box and keep the volume section 100
4. Click the “Start test” button and speak into the microphone
5. After that, click “Stop test.” If the greatest value it shows is above “0”, then your microphone works correctly

Now, restart your Voicemod app to see if it's working properly or not! If the issue still persists, jump to the next solution.

### Method 3: Install Windows Updates

If you use Windows 10, it has two kinds of updates that offer performance boost and security patches. Sometimes, an update can fix a few driver and software conflicts automatically.

You can quickly solve the voice chat problem by simply updating the system settings. Here's how to update your Windows 10:

1. Open your windows setting by pressing the “Windows button” and the “I” key together.
2. Click on “Update and Security”
3. Click the “Check for Updates” button. If an update is found, it will install automatically on the system

Make sure to repeat this process until it says you're up-to-date. Then, restart the PC. Check whether the Vociemod is properly working or not!

If not, try our next option!

### Method 4:Re-Install Voice Changer Voicemod Drivers

In many instances, the issue signifies that you're using outdated or faulty drivers. To troubleshoot this, simply re-install your Voicemod driver, and you'll be good to go!

First, uninstall your Voicemod driver from the windows PC/Mac. Here's how to do it:

1. On the keyboard, press the “Windows button” as well as the “I” key to bring up the “Run box”

# How to Share Screen on Discord?

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord is a group-chat app designed to bring together communities of like-minded people. It launched in 2015 aimed at gamers, and while it is still extremely popular in the gaming world it has also branched out to cover all manner of common interests and themes. You might want to get together to discuss a classic movie series, study on a project together, or just to get involved with the fanbase of your favorite YouTuber.

You don’t just have to chat via text – Discord makes it easy to have voice chats and [video calls](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and you can [share your screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) too – ideal whether you want to stream just to a smaller audience than something like Twitch, or you need your colleagues to review your work while you talk it through. Here I’ll take you through how to screen share on Discord step-by-step.

* [Part 3: How to Share Screen on a Discord Direct Message?](#part3)
* [Part 4: How to Change Settings While Screen Sharing on Discord?](#part4)
* [Discord Screen Sharing FAQs](#part5)

## Part 1: Settings for Screen Sharing on Discord

Before you get started with actually sharing your screen on Discord, you’ll want to make sure that you’ve got everything set up correctly.

Open up User Settings by clicking on the cog in the bottom left next to your username.

![How to Share Screen on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-interface.jpg)

Here you’ll find a handy option called ‘Voice & Video’. Use this to make sure that your audio settings are working correctly – both your microphone for communicating with the person you’re sharing your screen with, and your output so that you can hear them clearly too.

![Share Screen on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-voice-video-settings.jpg)

You can also update your video settings here, if you want to also be on camera while you share your screen. Adjust your webcam options and run a test if you want to see how it’s looking.

There are also plenty of clever options available if you want to tinker with things like Noise Suppression, Echo Cancellation and so on if you scroll down on this menu option. Have a play around if you want to, but for most people the default options will be sufficient.

Now, when you go to share your screen (which I’ll cover off below), you’ll be presented with one final option first – your resolution and [frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

![ Screen sharing Settings on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-screen-share-settings.jpg)

Here you can set the quality of the image you’ll be sharing. 480p and 720p (HD) are available by default along with 15fps and 30fps. If you want 1080p or to use the Source option, or 60fps, you’ll need to pay for a Discord Nitro account, which is an upgraded tier of membership that starts at $49.99 for the year or $4.99 per month.

## Part 2: How to Screen Share on a Discord Voice Channel Server?

Once your settings are ready, you’re good to go. You can currently share your screen using the online Discord browser or on the Discord app. You can’t screen share on mobile. Screen sharing works on Windows, Mac and Linux but you can **only share audio on Windows 10.**

With that out of the way, here’s how to screen share on Discord on the desktop app.

Firstly, you’ll need to be in a voice channel server. This means that you’ll need to be on a server that either you’ve set up or joined with friends, and active in the voice chat. You’ll start in a text channel by default, so make sure to join a voice channel. Once you’re here, you’ll be able to start chatting to anyone else in the voice channel.

![Invite People on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-invite-peope-voice-channel.jpg)

Once you’ve joined, you’ll see a new option at the bottom left of the screen to share your screen. Click this button and you’ll be presented with the option to start sharing your screen – you can choose which application you want to share specifically, or your whole screen.

![Choose Screen Sharing Window on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-choose-screen-sharing-window.jpg)

Once you’ve chosen your screen to share, you can set the settings as mentioned above.

It’s important to note that, if you’re sharing your screen via online Discord in your web browser, you won’t get these same customization options. When you click on share screen, you’ll just get the chance to choose which window you want to share, and it’ll look slightly different. Once done, you’ll be sharing – you can’t change your resolution or frame rate on the online browser. If that’s an issue, you might want to download the app – it is free to use and is often faster.

![Screen Sharing Settings on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-choose-screen-sharing-window-web.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Share Screen on a Discord Direct Message?

If you want to share your screen on Discord in a private direct message, the steps are slightly different. Firstly, there’s no automatic voice channel to join, so you’ll need to begin a video call. To do this, click on the video call button at the top right of your screen when you’re in your DM folder with the person you want to share your screen with.

![Satrt Video Call on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-direct-screen-sharing.jpg)

Then, you simply need to click the share screen button which will appear on your main call controls in the middle of the screen. Once done, you can share you screen in the same way as you would in a voice channel.

![Screen Sharing with Friends on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-screen-sharing-friends.jpg)

## Part 4: How to Change Settings While Screen Sharing on Discord?

Once you’ve started a screen share on Discord, you don’t need to stop and start again if you want to change any of the settings. Instead, you can alter them as you’re working. It’s quite simple too.

Firstly, when you’re sharing your screen, you’ll see a little pop-up window of your screen on Discord. Hover over this and you’ll see a cog with Stream Settings highlighted. Click on this cog.

![Discord Stream Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-stream-settings.jpg)

From here, you’ll get the stream settings menu where you can change the frame rate and resolution, or switch to a different window or application if you want to share something else.

![Screen Sharing Quality Changing on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-change-stream-quality-screen-sharing.jpg)

This is really useful if you want to work on different applications or projects at the same time, while lowering the resolution or frame rate can really help out if your stream is lagging. If the people you’re screen sharing with are finding that your stream is stuttering or your audio and video keep cutting out, try lowering the resolution and frame rate to make it more manageable.

## Discord Screen Sharing FAQs

#### 1\. How Can I Share Screen on Discord Mobile?

Unfortunately, if you’re using the Discord app on your Android or iOS smartphone, you won’t be able to share your screen. These operating systems block apps which record your screen, which means it’s not a feature that’s likely to come soon unless Discord can come to an agreement with Google and/or Apple. You can join a stream, and watch someone else’s screen, from your phone.

#### 2\. How Can I Share Screen on Discord Mobile?

By default, the only operating system that lets you share audio when you’re screen sharing is Windows 10\. So, if you’re using a MacBook or iMac, or you’re on a system running Linux or any other lesser-known OS, you won’t be able to share audio by default.

There are workarounds available, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/g0l2yw/mac%5Fscreen%5Fsharing%5Faudio%5Fworkaround/) that was shared on Reddit, but it involves a lot of steps and downloading of additional software. Always check downloads with your antivirus software.

#### 3\. How Many People Can I Share Screen With on Discord?

Traditionally, there was a limit of 10 people for any Go Live streams on Discord, to make sure that all users had a good experience without any performance issues. However, Discord themselves increased that limit from 10 users to 50 back in March 2020, to help people through the Coronavirus pandemic. No definitive end date has been given for the increased limit but it is expected to be lowered again.

#### 4\. Why Can’t I Share Screen on Discord?

If you’re struggling to share your screen on Discord, there are a number of potential issues. Firstly, make sure you’re on the desktop program and not the mobile app. Secondly, ensure you’re running Discord as an administrator. If it still isn’t working, try uninstalling and reinstalling Discord. If the new version doesn’t work, you may need to email [support@discordapp.com](mailto:support@discordapp.com).

#### 5\. Why My Screen Sharing Is Black on Discord?

If you share your screen but it is simply black, you might have an issue with your graphics hardware. Update your graphics card drivers, and update Discord to the latest version too. Make sure you close any unnecessary programs at the same time, as they might be using up precious memory which could be causing your screen share to fail.

#### 6\. How to Improve Discord Screen Share Quality?

If you want to improve your discord screen share quality because it is lagging, you’ll need to check whether your internet connection has a sufficient upload speed. Many broadband providers offer fast downloads but with slow upload speeds, so if you’re uploading a video it may stutter and struggle.

If you want to improve the video and frame rate of your screen sharing because you want it to look better, you’ll need to upgrade to Discord Nitro, which starts at $49.99 per year or $4.99 per month.

![How to Share Screen on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-interface.jpg)

Here you’ll find a handy option called ‘Voice & Video’. Use this to make sure that your audio settings are working correctly – both your microphone for communicating with the person you’re sharing your screen with, and your output so that you can hear them clearly too.

![Share Screen on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-voice-video-settings.jpg)

You can also update your video settings here, if you want to also be on camera while you share your screen. Adjust your webcam options and run a test if you want to see how it’s looking.

There are also plenty of clever options available if you want to tinker with things like Noise Suppression, Echo Cancellation and so on if you scroll down on this menu option. Have a play around if you want to, but for most people the default options will be sufficient.

Now, when you go to share your screen (which I’ll cover off below), you’ll be presented with one final option first – your resolution and [frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

![ Screen sharing Settings on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-screen-share-settings.jpg)

Here you can set the quality of the image you’ll be sharing. 480p and 720p (HD) are available by default along with 15fps and 30fps. If you want 1080p or to use the Source option, or 60fps, you’ll need to pay for a Discord Nitro account, which is an upgraded tier of membership that starts at $49.99 for the year or $4.99 per month.

## Part 2: How to Screen Share on a Discord Voice Channel Server?

Once your settings are ready, you’re good to go. You can currently share your screen using the online Discord browser or on the Discord app. You can’t screen share on mobile. Screen sharing works on Windows, Mac and Linux but you can **only share audio on Windows 10.**

With that out of the way, here’s how to screen share on Discord on the desktop app.

Firstly, you’ll need to be in a voice channel server. This means that you’ll need to be on a server that either you’ve set up or joined with friends, and active in the voice chat. You’ll start in a text channel by default, so make sure to join a voice channel. Once you’re here, you’ll be able to start chatting to anyone else in the voice channel.

![Invite People on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-invite-peope-voice-channel.jpg)

Once you’ve joined, you’ll see a new option at the bottom left of the screen to share your screen. Click this button and you’ll be presented with the option to start sharing your screen – you can choose which application you want to share specifically, or your whole screen.

![Choose Screen Sharing Window on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-choose-screen-sharing-window.jpg)

Once you’ve chosen your screen to share, you can set the settings as mentioned above.

It’s important to note that, if you’re sharing your screen via online Discord in your web browser, you won’t get these same customization options. When you click on share screen, you’ll just get the chance to choose which window you want to share, and it’ll look slightly different. Once done, you’ll be sharing – you can’t change your resolution or frame rate on the online browser. If that’s an issue, you might want to download the app – it is free to use and is often faster.

![Screen Sharing Settings on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-choose-screen-sharing-window-web.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Share Screen on a Discord Direct Message?

If you want to share your screen on Discord in a private direct message, the steps are slightly different. Firstly, there’s no automatic voice channel to join, so you’ll need to begin a video call. To do this, click on the video call button at the top right of your screen when you’re in your DM folder with the person you want to share your screen with.

![Satrt Video Call on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-direct-screen-sharing.jpg)

Then, you simply need to click the share screen button which will appear on your main call controls in the middle of the screen. Once done, you can share you screen in the same way as you would in a voice channel.

![Screen Sharing with Friends on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-screen-sharing-friends.jpg)

## Part 4: How to Change Settings While Screen Sharing on Discord?

Once you’ve started a screen share on Discord, you don’t need to stop and start again if you want to change any of the settings. Instead, you can alter them as you’re working. It’s quite simple too.

Firstly, when you’re sharing your screen, you’ll see a little pop-up window of your screen on Discord. Hover over this and you’ll see a cog with Stream Settings highlighted. Click on this cog.

![Discord Stream Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-stream-settings.jpg)

From here, you’ll get the stream settings menu where you can change the frame rate and resolution, or switch to a different window or application if you want to share something else.

![Screen Sharing Quality Changing on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-change-stream-quality-screen-sharing.jpg)

This is really useful if you want to work on different applications or projects at the same time, while lowering the resolution or frame rate can really help out if your stream is lagging. If the people you’re screen sharing with are finding that your stream is stuttering or your audio and video keep cutting out, try lowering the resolution and frame rate to make it more manageable.

## Discord Screen Sharing FAQs

#### 1\. How Can I Share Screen on Discord Mobile?

Unfortunately, if you’re using the Discord app on your Android or iOS smartphone, you won’t be able to share your screen. These operating systems block apps which record your screen, which means it’s not a feature that’s likely to come soon unless Discord can come to an agreement with Google and/or Apple. You can join a stream, and watch someone else’s screen, from your phone.

#### 2\. How Can I Share Screen on Discord Mobile?

By default, the only operating system that lets you share audio when you’re screen sharing is Windows 10\. So, if you’re using a MacBook or iMac, or you’re on a system running Linux or any other lesser-known OS, you won’t be able to share audio by default.

There are workarounds available, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/g0l2yw/mac%5Fscreen%5Fsharing%5Faudio%5Fworkaround/) that was shared on Reddit, but it involves a lot of steps and downloading of additional software. Always check downloads with your antivirus software.

#### 3\. How Many People Can I Share Screen With on Discord?

Traditionally, there was a limit of 10 people for any Go Live streams on Discord, to make sure that all users had a good experience without any performance issues. However, Discord themselves increased that limit from 10 users to 50 back in March 2020, to help people through the Coronavirus pandemic. No definitive end date has been given for the increased limit but it is expected to be lowered again.

#### 4\. Why Can’t I Share Screen on Discord?

If you’re struggling to share your screen on Discord, there are a number of potential issues. Firstly, make sure you’re on the desktop program and not the mobile app. Secondly, ensure you’re running Discord as an administrator. If it still isn’t working, try uninstalling and reinstalling Discord. If the new version doesn’t work, you may need to email [support@discordapp.com](mailto:support@discordapp.com).

#### 5\. Why My Screen Sharing Is Black on Discord?

If you share your screen but it is simply black, you might have an issue with your graphics hardware. Update your graphics card drivers, and update Discord to the latest version too. Make sure you close any unnecessary programs at the same time, as they might be using up precious memory which could be causing your screen share to fail.

#### 6\. How to Improve Discord Screen Share Quality?

If you want to improve your discord screen share quality because it is lagging, you’ll need to check whether your internet connection has a sufficient upload speed. Many broadband providers offer fast downloads but with slow upload speeds, so if you’re uploading a video it may stutter and struggle.

If you want to improve the video and frame rate of your screen sharing because you want it to look better, you’ll need to upgrade to Discord Nitro, which starts at $49.99 per year or $4.99 per month.

Discord is a group-chat app designed to bring together communities of like-minded people. It launched in 2015 aimed at gamers, and while it is still extremely popular in the gaming world it has also branched out to cover all manner of common interests and themes. You might want to get together to discuss a classic movie series, study on a project together, or just to get involved with the fanbase of your favorite YouTuber.

You don’t just have to chat via text – Discord makes it easy to have voice chats and [video calls](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and you can [share your screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) too – ideal whether you want to stream just to a smaller audience than something like Twitch, or you need your colleagues to review your work while you talk it through. Here I’ll take you through how to screen share on Discord step-by-step.
