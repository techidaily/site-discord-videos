After you click the button, you’ll have to sign in to your discord account and it will then ask which server you wish to add the bot to.

If you aren’t very good with commands and such then this is the bot for you. Don’t get me wrong, you still need commands but there are less commands and more visual options like reacting to the bot message with a certain emoji.

![ Among Us Helper Bot ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/among-us-helper-au-bot.jpg)

To begin an Among Us Helper session, run the command

au!start (optional) <GameCode> <Region>

Once you do that, go to the channel that the command tells you the control panel is in.

The control panel has a bunch of reactions that allow you to do certain things.

* The Start game reaction deafens and mutes everyone
* Start meeting reaction mutes ghosts and unmutes and undeafens all alive players
* The set dead reaction sets you as dead and unmutes/undeafens you so that you talk to other ghosts
* And more.

## Part 2: How to Add an Among Us Bot to a Discord Server?

Adding a bot to your server is pretty easy, first decide what bot you want to add and then go over to it’s site. In this example we’ll be using Among Us Manager Bot as an example.

After going to the Website, click the invite link button. Some websites might not have a button to “invite link”. In that case, look for a different button like “invite/add” etc.

After you click the button, you’ll have to sign in to your discord account and it will then ask which server you wish to add the bot to.

![Connect Among Us Manager  Bot to Discord ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/connect-among-us-manager-to-discord.jpg)

Just select a server and then click continue.

Next, it’ll ask what permissions you want to give to the bot. Go over this carefully and select the ones you want. But you may lose some functions if a certain permission isn’t given.

![Connect Among Us Manager  Bot to Discord Permission Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/connect-among-us-manager-to-discord-permission-settings.jpg)

Click Authorize. It will then ask you to verify whether you’re human or not. If you pass this little test, the bot will be added to your selected server.

You can then go over to your server in discord and found your bot there.

Now all that’s left is getting your friends and hoping into a fun filled and thrilled game of the murder mystery game Among Us.

**Conclusion:**

In the end, all the Among Us bots are basically used to mute players and unmute them at certain points so that there is no cheating and everyone can play the game fairly and it doesn’t get ruined because of some toxic rotten tomatoes.
