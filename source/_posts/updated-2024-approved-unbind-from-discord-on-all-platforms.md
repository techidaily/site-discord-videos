[Discord is a voice and text chat service](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to bring like-minded people together, especially e-sports professionals.

The goal was to provide users with an improved communications platform that could streamline the way people speak in real-time and over the internet.

Originally designed for gamers, the app allowed users to communicate with others who share interests on a given topic.

After a while, the Discord app expanded its reach and included non-gamers as well. Today, it is one of the most popular chatting apps out there.

However, if, for any reason, you want to delete or disable your account for good, you can. In the following articles, you will learn about how to delete your account step by step.

## Part 1: How To Delete A Discord Account Permanently?

Are you done with a game, scared about your data, or just bored with the app? No problem! If you want to learn how to delete your discord account, look no further.

But before doing so, you’ll have to do two quick things:

* Reassign ‘administrative rights’ of the servers
* Completely delete them

The only reason you will have to think about these things is if you assumed responsibility for any server.

Without further ado, here are some easy to follow steps to delete a Discord account permanently:

1. Open the Discord app
2. Sign in to your Discord account and open the user settings option (Cog icon)

![How to Delete Discord Account - Go to My Account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-discord-my-account.jpg)

1. Click the “My Account” option in the user setting menu. At the very bottom of the screen, you’ll see the “delete account” option

![Delete Discord Account Permantely - Account Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-delete-account-option.jpg)

1. Click the delete account button to make your Discord account disappear!

However, if you’ve activated 2FA, you may also be asked to put your password and 2FA code.

Also, if you want to delete your account permanently, there are some things you need to do before completing the process.

As mentioned before, if you’re the server’s owner, you’ll have to either delete your server or transfer its ownership to a trusted source.

For transferring ownership on Discord, follow these steps:

1. Open the Discord app
2. Click the “server name,” and a range of options will open; then click “server setting”
3. At the bottom-left of the screen, click the ‘members’ option below “User Management”
4. Here you’ll make the critical decision of who gets the keys to your kingdom. Once you decide who to transfer the ownership to, click the “3 vertical dots”
5. As the “dialog menu” opens, click “Transfer Ownership”

Once it’s completed, you’ll become a regular server member. Your access to the server will be limited and as per the set position.

On the other hand, if you don’t want to transfer its ownership to someone else, you can also delete it.

Here’s how you can delete the server to complete the process of deleting your Discord account:

1. Click the “Server Name” again
2. Within the several options, click the “Server Settings.”
3. At the bottom-left of your window, click the “Delete Server” option in the “User Management” section.

![Delete Discord Server to Delete Account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-discord-server-account.jpg)

1. Once clicked, the system will ask you to enter the account password to delete your server (or servers) from existence altogether

Like the primary Discord account deletion process, if you have enabled 2FA on this account, you’ll have to put in the code to get things completed.

After this, you’ll be asked one more time to click the “delete server” button before it is completely deleted. Keep in mind that you’ll have 14 days time to recover your Discord account. Once the two-week time passes, you won’t be able to retrieve or sign in to your account.

Once the account is deleted, the username will show up as “deleteduser 0000” or something similar to this. However, users you have texted via your account will still see your texts.

## Part 2: How to Delete Discord Account From iPhone And Android?

Yes, you can delete the discord account from iPhone and Android. And if you’re wondering how to delete a Discord account, Here’s a quick way to do it:

1. Open your updated discord app and tap the “hamburger” menu located at the top-left
2. Tap the gear icon so you can go to the “user settings.”
3. Select “My Account”
4. Below the “Account Management” option, choose “Delete Account” and put your password and 2FA (if you have set it up)

## Part 3: How To Disable Discord Account On Desktop Computer?

Deleting the account means you won’t be able to use it further, whereas disabling the account normally means you’re taking a little break.

So, if you don’t want to remove or delete your account entirely but only want it gone for some time, choose the disable option.

Here’s how you can disable a Discord account on a desktop computer:

1. Open the app on your window PC/Mac and then log in to your Discord account
2. Click the “User Settings” option and then go to the “My Account” option within the user settings
3. In the lower corner of your Mac/PC screen, you’ll see the “Disable Account” button next to the “Delete Account” button

![How to disable discord account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/disable-discord-account.jpg)

1. Click the “Disable Account” option, and it will be disabled.

#### **What’s The Difference Between Disabling And Deleting A Discord Account?**

Disabling the account means you can recover it anytime you want, unlike deleting the account where you only have a 14-day restoration window. Additionally, when the account is disabled, you won’t receive notifications, but you will still get “friend requests.”

## Part 4: How To Disable Discord Account On Mobile?

Disabling your Discord account for Android and iOS isn’t as simple as it is on a Desktop Windows/Mac PC.

Currently, there is no direct way to either delete or disable your Discord account through a mobile device.

2. Tap the cog icon on the lower right corner of the phone
3. Tap on the “My Account” option in the “User Settings” menu
4. You’ll have the choice to either “Delete Account” or “Disable Account.” However, whatever you choose, you’ll be prompted to the support page explaining ways to disable or delete your account
5. To complete disabling process from a mobile device, you’ll have to send a request to the support team, as it’s the only way to disable your account via your smartphone

With Discord, you can [text with emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and even send GIFs. However, as servers become crowded, they get bombarded with texts. And some of these texts have spoilers for games (or other stuff) that others may not want to know or read. But ignoring spoilers was not that easy. As you scroll miles and miles of texts, your eyes are bound to catch some hints and ruin the suspense for you.

Thankfully, Discord came out with the perfect solution. Now, if you are sharing some spoilers or secrets, you can mark them as spoilers. The result is a text that is sent but is blacked out. Curious users who are not scared of spoilers can view it. Others can enjoy their bliss of ignorance.

1. Open the Discord app and log in using your credentials.
2. Pick a server from your server list or a friend from the friend list.

![add spoiler tag to Discord  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoiler-tag-discord.jpg)

This works for the Discord desktop app, browser, and also mobile app. This is like a universal method of hiding spoilers.

You can also add ‘/spoiler’ before the spoiler content. This is an alternative to the ‘||’ we add at the start and the end.

![add spoiler marker on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoiler-icon.jpg)

This method is available only on the Discord desktop app and browser version. For iOS, the steps are similar. The only difference is that you have to select the spoiler mark from the context menu.

## Part 2: How to Add Spoiler to Image and Video on Discord?

There are many scenarios where a **Discord spoiler** can come in handy. As you might be aware that Discord is quite popular and its cross-platform flexibility make it a favorite among gamers. You can connect to your friends over multiple devices with a single account.

Just like texts, even images, videos, and other attachments can be marked as spoilers. The process of marking images and videos as spoilers differs slightly from that of texts. So, how to add spoiler tags to other files? Here’s the rundown.

![add spoiler to image and video on Discord  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoilers-to-image-video.jpg)

Images can be tagged as spoilers before you upload them on servers. To add spoiler tags to images –

* Open Discord on your desktop app or browser.
* Select the image or video that you want to send on the server.
* Drag it to your server chat and drop it there.
* Next, tap on the ‘+’ symbol.
* From the options that appear, choose 'Mark as Spoiler.'
* Hit the Upload button.
* The result is a blurred image sent on the server. Anyone who wishes to view the image can tap on it.

Note that spoilers that contain images, videos, or other multimedia files can be sent only on the desktop app or the browser. Mobile apps do not support spoiler marks for images or other media files.

## Bonus: Is it the same to use Spoiler on Mobile devices?

The **Discord mobile spoiler** tag works the same on mobile apps. The process is more or less the same. Here is a quick rundown of the steps –

1. Type out the spoiler text.
2. Add ‘||’ symbols at the start and end of the text you want to hide.
3. Hit the send button, and your spoiler text will be covered.
4. Only the curious ones can tap and see your spoiler texts.

You can even mark embedded links as spoilers with the same process. But this does not apply to Discord server links. Furthermore, **you cannot add spoiler tags to images, videos, and other files from the mobile app.**

For iOS, you can select and highlight the text that you want to hide. Then, tap open the context menu and click on the ‘Mark as Spoiler’ to hide the text.

## Bonus: How to turn off the Spoiler tag?

For some reason, you may want to remove the spoiler tag from the spoiler texts. In that case, open the User Settings and tap on Text & Images. Scroll down to the Show Spoiler Content tab and you will see options to control when spoiler content is displayed. You can choose to display on click, on servers I moderate, and always.

If you want to display all spoiler content, choose Always to turn off the spoiler tag. You can hide them again through the same menu if you change your mind.
