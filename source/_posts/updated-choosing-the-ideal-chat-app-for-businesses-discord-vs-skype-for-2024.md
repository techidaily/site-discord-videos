 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

What would be a catchy but concise way to describe Discord? A modern voice and text communication app that's free.

It's also wildly popular with gamers, secure with DDoS protection, and compatible with desktops as well as mobiles.

And what if you had to describe Skype in a similar manner? An all-in-one app for voice calls, messaging, video conferencing, and file transfer that allows you to connect with others no matter where you are.

Employees need to rely on VoIP apps like Skype and Discord to maintain communication with their colleagues and clients.

You might be wondering which is the better option among the two? Is Skype better than Discord, given that it's more popular and been around for longer?

Or is Discord more secure than Skype? Both these apps have different backgrounds and target different audiences. While Discord is more popular with gamers, Skype is readily used in offices.

Yet, at the same time, both offer similar sets of features that most users require from VoIP apps. So, let's get into discussing which VoIP app is better: Skype or Discord?

## Which Platform Is Better: Discord or Skype?

Our criteria will consider some aspects that are important when discussing communication platforms.

These include Privacy, Security, Sound Quality, Group Calls, Screen Sharing, Call Recording, File Sharing, The Interface, Supported platforms.

### 1. Privacy

Both Skype and Discord can be classified as VoIP apps because of their similar functionalities. However, there are also many differences in their features and who they cater to.

But when considering privacy, both apps seemed to be lacking.

Unfortunately, there have been reports of data breaches from both apps, with users complaining of having their locations and personal data compromised and leaked.

Neither of these apps promises complete privacy, and our recommendation would be to use them in combination with a reliable VPN service.

### 2. Security

Discord offers its users both DDoS and IP address protection, offering full client-to-server security.

On the other hand, Skype was rated poorly for its security but has recently upgraded its measures, hiding user's IP addresses.

### 3. Sound Quality

Discord differs from Skype in its audio-transmission methods and data usage. Skype works much like a phone connection, transmitting audio data continuously, like a phone call. In contrast, Discord only sends audio data when a user speaks during a call.

Both apps differ in their recommended bandwidth, with Skype having an extensive bandwidth of 100 kbps for voice calls and Discord with only 64 kbps in comparison.

For this reason, we would rank Skype higher than Discord for sound quality and audio transmission.

### 4. Group Calls

When comparing the two for group calls, Skype trumps Discord as the better and more widely popular option.

With Skype, users can make group audio and video calls, with as many as 25 people at the same time. On the other hand, Discord limits the number of users who can join a group call to just 10.

Also, Skype allows users to make calls on other phone numbers, including landlines, while Discord only limits calls to other Discord users.

Overall, Skype comes through as a much better choice for group calling.

### 5. Screen Sharing

In this age of remote working, the need for screen-sharing has increased drastically to enhance professional collaboration.

In this regard, both Discord and Skype offer a decent screen-sharing experience.

With Skype, users can [share their screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) even during audio calls, and it is relatively easy to do so, requiring only a single click to start screen-sharing. Plus, it allows users to take a simple screenshot as well.

In comparison, [Discord offers screen-sharing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) options that are more customizable and thorough, with more features for users to benefit from, such as fragmented sharing for people who don't want to share their full screen.

When comparing the two, Discord offers more customization, while Skype offers simple features but is more dependable and convenient. Therefore, Discord edges Skype out by a slight margin for its customizable features.

### 6. Call Recording

Skype has a definitive advantage over Discord in this department, as there is no in-built audio or video recording feature or option in Discord.

Users cannot record calls on Discord, while [Skype does grant a call recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) option for both video and audio calls.

It must be noted that the call recording feature in Skype is a recent addition, after frequent customer complaints about the lack of any call recording option.

It is also relatively simple to do so on Skype; click on the "+" icon and tap on "Start Recording." This procedure works for both the desktop and mobile versions of Skype.

However, Discord users do not need to despair, as there is a way out for their call recording woes:

They can record calls by [installing third-party apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/); however, there have been controversies regarding data breaches through third-party apps, so we'd advise treading with caution.

### 7. File Sharing

Both Discord and Skype allow their users to share multiple files with unlimited users; however, they seem to differ in the file volume that can be shared.

For Skype users, this limit is restricted to files up to 300MB. If the file volume exceeds this limit, the users will be redirected to OneDrive to share with as many users as they want.

Compared to Skype, Discord's file volume limit varies, depending on free users and Nitro users. The file limit for free users is a rather mediocre 8MB, while Nitro users have an ample limit of 50MB.

The monthly subscription for Nitro costs $4.99, so if you're looking for free options, Skype takes the win here.

When considered objectively, the Discord free version is somewhat limiting, and users will need to move onto Discord Nitro if they wish to post pictures or videos.

However, Discord does offer its users external cloud storage platforms. These storage platforms require bots to create shortcuts when exceeding the sharing limit and can be rather tedious. Overall, Skype seems to take the lead in file sharing.

### 8. The Interface

Both Skype and Discord have different interfaces, with Skype following a minimalistic layout and interface from its inception.

Since then, it has incorporated new updates and additions to account for new features that boost the user experience.

![Skype Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-interface.jpg)

Skype has traditionally been considered a business tool, ideal for making landline and international calls, with perfect compatibility with most business apps.

On the other hand, Discord is not as easy to use as Skype because of its more complex layout.

Discord, unlike Skype, is much more than a VoIP app. The gaming community relies on it to stream gaming sessions; online fan clubs also use it to share content among their communities.

Instead of just an app used to make calls, Discords presents itself as a forum for peers to hang out online.

![Discord Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

Additionally, due to its tilt towards the gaming community, Discord includes a unique feature, where each time a user makes a call, they are assigned a server. Other users can join this server without the original users having to leave their game.

This way, gamers can display their gaming skills to others in real-time. These calls are called drop-in calls and require no invites, meaning you can chat with anyone without them being your friend inside a server.

Due to its enhanced useability, Discord wins this category!

### 9. Supported Platforms

In this regard, Discord wins over Skype with a considerable lead. Discord allows users to sync with Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Steam, and many other apps, making it easy to find friends and families and connect with them.

It even allows you to check what music your friends are listening to on Spotify!

In contrast, Skype is considerably limited as it only syncs with Facebook. However, its value lies in its compatibility with business apps, notably Docs, Excel, and Powerpoint, as well as polls and whiteboard.

Recently, you will find Skype Business to be included in the Office 365 Suite, costing $8.99 as a whole.

## Skype Vs. Discord: Which One Should You Choose?

These apps deliver much of the essential features that users expect from top VoIP apps, yet they cater to different sets of users.

While Skype allows you to make mobile and landline calls by buying credit online, Discord limits itself to only app-to-app communications.

Skype also offers bots that can be found using the search option. These bots include games and music bots, but compared to Discord, they're somewhat limited.

Discord's bots keep in spirit with its gaming audience and include a diverse range of features, including some that allow you to play games, play music or create memes.

In contrast, Skype is considerably business-oriented, allowing you to host large meetings with 250 participants.

All in all, both of these apps offer unique features for their intended audiences. How useful you find each app depends on the category you belong to.

If you're a gamer who likes to connect with other gamers or stream videos, Discord is the choice for you. However, if you are a business professional looking to host video conferences, Skype is the better option.

In case that you want to record the desktop screen and the audio simultaneously, you should try Wondershare Filmora, which provides both the recording and editing tools.

With Skype, users can [share their screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) even during audio calls, and it is relatively easy to do so, requiring only a single click to start screen-sharing. Plus, it allows users to take a simple screenshot as well.

In comparison, [Discord offers screen-sharing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) options that are more customizable and thorough, with more features for users to benefit from, such as fragmented sharing for people who don't want to share their full screen.

When comparing the two, Discord offers more customization, while Skype offers simple features but is more dependable and convenient. Therefore, Discord edges Skype out by a slight margin for its customizable features.

### 6. Call Recording

Skype has a definitive advantage over Discord in this department, as there is no in-built audio or video recording feature or option in Discord.

Users cannot record calls on Discord, while [Skype does grant a call recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) option for both video and audio calls.

It must be noted that the call recording feature in Skype is a recent addition, after frequent customer complaints about the lack of any call recording option.

It is also relatively simple to do so on Skype; click on the "+" icon and tap on "Start Recording." This procedure works for both the desktop and mobile versions of Skype.

However, Discord users do not need to despair, as there is a way out for their call recording woes:

They can record calls by [installing third-party apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/); however, there have been controversies regarding data breaches through third-party apps, so we'd advise treading with caution.

### 7. File Sharing

Both Discord and Skype allow their users to share multiple files with unlimited users; however, they seem to differ in the file volume that can be shared.

For Skype users, this limit is restricted to files up to 300MB. If the file volume exceeds this limit, the users will be redirected to OneDrive to share with as many users as they want.

Compared to Skype, Discord's file volume limit varies, depending on free users and Nitro users. The file limit for free users is a rather mediocre 8MB, while Nitro users have an ample limit of 50MB.

The monthly subscription for Nitro costs $4.99, so if you're looking for free options, Skype takes the win here.

When considered objectively, the Discord free version is somewhat limiting, and users will need to move onto Discord Nitro if they wish to post pictures or videos.

However, Discord does offer its users external cloud storage platforms. These storage platforms require bots to create shortcuts when exceeding the sharing limit and can be rather tedious. Overall, Skype seems to take the lead in file sharing.

### 8. The Interface

Both Skype and Discord have different interfaces, with Skype following a minimalistic layout and interface from its inception.

Since then, it has incorporated new updates and additions to account for new features that boost the user experience.

![Skype Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-interface.jpg)

Skype has traditionally been considered a business tool, ideal for making landline and international calls, with perfect compatibility with most business apps.

On the other hand, Discord is not as easy to use as Skype because of its more complex layout.

Discord, unlike Skype, is much more than a VoIP app. The gaming community relies on it to stream gaming sessions; online fan clubs also use it to share content among their communities.

Instead of just an app used to make calls, Discords presents itself as a forum for peers to hang out online.

![Discord Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

Additionally, due to its tilt towards the gaming community, Discord includes a unique feature, where each time a user makes a call, they are assigned a server. Other users can join this server without the original users having to leave their game.

This way, gamers can display their gaming skills to others in real-time. These calls are called drop-in calls and require no invites, meaning you can chat with anyone without them being your friend inside a server.

Due to its enhanced useability, Discord wins this category!

### 9. Supported Platforms

In this regard, Discord wins over Skype with a considerable lead. Discord allows users to sync with Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Steam, and many other apps, making it easy to find friends and families and connect with them.

It even allows you to check what music your friends are listening to on Spotify!

In contrast, Skype is considerably limited as it only syncs with Facebook. However, its value lies in its compatibility with business apps, notably Docs, Excel, and Powerpoint, as well as polls and whiteboard.

Recently, you will find Skype Business to be included in the Office 365 Suite, costing $8.99 as a whole.

## Skype Vs. Discord: Which One Should You Choose?

These apps deliver much of the essential features that users expect from top VoIP apps, yet they cater to different sets of users.

While Skype allows you to make mobile and landline calls by buying credit online, Discord limits itself to only app-to-app communications.

Skype also offers bots that can be found using the search option. These bots include games and music bots, but compared to Discord, they're somewhat limited.

Discord's bots keep in spirit with its gaming audience and include a diverse range of features, including some that allow you to play games, play music or create memes.

In contrast, Skype is considerably business-oriented, allowing you to host large meetings with 250 participants.

All in all, both of these apps offer unique features for their intended audiences. How useful you find each app depends on the category you belong to.

If you're a gamer who likes to connect with other gamers or stream videos, Discord is the choice for you. However, if you are a business professional looking to host video conferences, Skype is the better option.

In case that you want to record the desktop screen and the audio simultaneously, you should try Wondershare Filmora, which provides both the recording and editing tools.

Discord is a great place to hang out with like-minded people and just relax. But sometimes you want to do more than just chat using text messaging, which is where [video calling](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) comes in handy.

Discord has video call options built into the desktop app, the web browser and the mobile app, so you donâ€™t need to switch between different software when you want to chat on video with your friends or colleagues. Read on to find out how to make a video call on Discord.

* [Part 1: Best Settings for Discord Video Call](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Make a Server Video Call on Discord?](#part3)
* [Part 4: FAQs about Discord Video Call](#part4)

## Part 1: Best Settings for Discord Video Call

Before you start calling everyone, youâ€™ll want to check your settings to make sure you have the best experience. Itâ€™s important to make sure youâ€™ve got your best equipment setup to work for the highest quality audio and video possible.

![Discord User Settings option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

So, start by heading to the User Settings page. Youâ€™ll find this at the bottom left of the screen â€“ look for the cog icon next to your name. You wonâ€™t see this on mobile, this is only on the desktop app and the web browser version of Discord.

![Discord Video Call Settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-settings.jpg)

Once youâ€™ve opened settings, youâ€™ll want to click on the **Voice & Video** tab. Here you can check your microphone settings and adjust the volume, and choose your camera. If youâ€™re using an external camera instead of the built-in option, check that the right one is selected in the dropdown.

You can also use this opportunity to run a test video â€“ so that you know youâ€™re well-lit, properly framed and otherwise good to go. You can adjust the lighting in your room or move the camera if you donâ€™t feel itâ€™s quite right.

One quick note for the web browser version of Discord â€“ youâ€™ll be asked to grant permission to your microphone and camera. Make sure you allow the site to use your equipment otherwise it wonâ€™t work on the video call.

Once you are happy, just click the close button at the top right of the settings options.

## Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?

Once youâ€™ve got your settings ready, youâ€™re set to make your private Discord video call. If youâ€™re doing it on the web browser or desktop app, youâ€™ll need to first navigate to the inbox you share with the person you want to call. Do this by clicking on the Home button at the top left â€“ youâ€™ll then get a list of all your contacts.

If youâ€™re only calling one person then itâ€™s easy â€“ just click on their name.

![Discord Video Call with Friends ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-discord-friend.jpg)

If you want to call a private group, you need to click the + button and then create a group DM. Add the names of the users you want to call.

![Discord Video Call with group ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friend-group-video-call-discord.jpg)

Once youâ€™re in the direct message window of the person or group you want to call, you need to look at the buttons at the top right of the screen. The second icon that looks like a video camera is the one youâ€™re looking for. Click that and youâ€™ll start a video call.

Youâ€™ll see yourself on screen at this point, but youâ€™ll need to wait until the other person or group members have joined the call for the chat to properly begin.

![Discord Video Call interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg)

The process of making video call on Discord mobile is essentially identical. You just need to open the direct message group and click on the video call icon, which is still at the top right of your screen.

![Discord Video Call interface on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discrod-personal-video-call-mobile.jpg)

Youâ€™ll need to give permissions for the Discord mobile app to use your microphone and camera if you havenâ€™t already.

Once youâ€™ve finished your video call on either desktop or mobile, just hit the red button to end it and switch your camera off again.

## Part 3: How to Make a Server Video Call on Discord?

If you want to make a group video call on a public server, you again need to first navigate to the server. Once youâ€™re there, youâ€™ll need to join the voice channel that you should see on the left side of the screen.

Once youâ€™re in the voice channel, click Lounge, Community Hangout or Stream Room, and then switch on your camera by clicking the â€˜Videoâ€™ button. Youâ€™ll find this at the bottom-left of the screen. Again, if youâ€™re on the web browser, youâ€™ll be asked by your browser for permission to use your camera at this stage.

![Discord Server Video Call  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-video-call.jpg)

And thatâ€™s it â€“ the video call is now live and anyone who joins the voice channel will be able to see you, chat to you and switch on their camera to join the video conference as well.

On mobile, itâ€™s slightly different. Youâ€™ll still want to head to the server you want to join and then click on the voice channel to join it. But as soon as you click on the voice channel, youâ€™ll get a pop-up with an icon at the bottom right where you can instantly switch on your camera.

![Discord Server Video Call on mobile  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-video-call-mobile.jpg)

If you prefer, you can still just join as voice, and then at any stage click on your name where youâ€™ll be able to then switch on your camera to turn a voice chat into a video call.

Whenever you want to end the video call, just click on your name again to switch off your camera, or disconnect completely from the voice channel.

## FAQs About Discord Video Chat Call

#### 1\. How Many People Can Join in the Discord Group Video Call?

Normally, the limit for the number of users on a group video call in Discord is 10\. However, during the Coronavirus pandemic, the team behind Discord know that itâ€™s a valuable tool to help people stay connected. So the limit has been increased to 25 users. This may be reduced in the future once the world returns to some sense of normality.

#### 2\. How to Join a Video Call on Discord?

Joining an existing video call on Discord is a really easy process.

If itâ€™s a private video call, youâ€™ll get a pop-up in the chat window letting you know that a video call has been started. You have the option of declining the video call, joining it with video, or just joining with voice without your camera switched on.

If instead, itâ€™s a public server where a video call is happening, you just need to join the voice channel by clicking on it on the left side of the screen, and then clicking on the video button next to your name, just as if you were starting the call in the first place.

You can also use this opportunity to run a test video â€“ so that you know youâ€™re well-lit, properly framed and otherwise good to go. You can adjust the lighting in your room or move the camera if you donâ€™t feel itâ€™s quite right.

One quick note for the web browser version of Discord â€“ youâ€™ll be asked to grant permission to your microphone and camera. Make sure you allow the site to use your equipment otherwise it wonâ€™t work on the video call.

Once you are happy, just click the close button at the top right of the settings options.

## Part 2: How to Make a Private Video Call on Discord?

Once youâ€™ve got your settings ready, youâ€™re set to make your private Discord video call. If youâ€™re doing it on the web browser or desktop app, youâ€™ll need to first navigate to the inbox you share with the person you want to call. Do this by clicking on the Home button at the top left â€“ youâ€™ll then get a list of all your contacts.

If youâ€™re only calling one person then itâ€™s easy â€“ just click on their name.

![Discord Video Call with Friends ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-discord-friend.jpg)

If you want to call a private group, you need to click the + button and then create a group DM. Add the names of the users you want to call.

![Discord Video Call with group ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friend-group-video-call-discord.jpg)

Once youâ€™re in the direct message window of the person or group you want to call, you need to look at the buttons at the top right of the screen. The second icon that looks like a video camera is the one youâ€™re looking for. Click that and youâ€™ll start a video call.

Youâ€™ll see yourself on screen at this point, but youâ€™ll need to wait until the other person or group members have joined the call for the chat to properly begin.

![Discord Video Call interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-video-call-desktop-interface.jpg)

The process of making video call on Discord mobile is essentially identical. You just need to open the direct message group and click on the video call icon, which is still at the top right of your screen.

![Discord Video Call interface on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discrod-personal-video-call-mobile.jpg)

Youâ€™ll need to give permissions for the Discord mobile app to use your microphone and camera if you havenâ€™t already.

Once youâ€™ve finished your video call on either desktop or mobile, just hit the red button to end it and switch your camera off again.

## Part 3: How to Make a Server Video Call on Discord?

If you want to make a group video call on a public server, you again need to first navigate to the server. Once youâ€™re there, youâ€™ll need to join the voice channel that you should see on the left side of the screen.

Once youâ€™re in the voice channel, click Lounge, Community Hangout or Stream Room, and then switch on your camera by clicking the â€˜Videoâ€™ button. Youâ€™ll find this at the bottom-left of the screen. Again, if youâ€™re on the web browser, youâ€™ll be asked by your browser for permission to use your camera at this stage.

![Discord Server Video Call  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-video-call.jpg)

And thatâ€™s it â€“ the video call is now live and anyone who joins the voice channel will be able to see you, chat to you and switch on their camera to join the video conference as well.

On mobile, itâ€™s slightly different. Youâ€™ll still want to head to the server you want to join and then click on the voice channel to join it. But as soon as you click on the voice channel, youâ€™ll get a pop-up with an icon at the bottom right where you can instantly switch on your camera.

![Discord Server Video Call on mobile  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-video-call-mobile.jpg)

If you prefer, you can still just join as voice, and then at any stage click on your name where youâ€™ll be able to then switch on your camera to turn a voice chat into a video call.

Whenever you want to end the video call, just click on your name again to switch off your camera, or disconnect completely from the voice channel.

## FAQs About Discord Video Chat Call

#### 1\. How Many People Can Join in the Discord Group Video Call?

Normally, the limit for the number of users on a group video call in Discord is 10\. However, during the Coronavirus pandemic, the team behind Discord know that itâ€™s a valuable tool to help people stay connected. So the limit has been increased to 25 users. This may be reduced in the future once the world returns to some sense of normality.

#### 2\. How to Join a Video Call on Discord?

Joining an existing video call on Discord is a really easy process.

If itâ€™s a private video call, youâ€™ll get a pop-up in the chat window letting you know that a video call has been started. You have the option of declining the video call, joining it with video, or just joining with voice without your camera switched on.

If instead, itâ€™s a public server where a video call is happening, you just need to join the voice channel by clicking on it on the left side of the screen, and then clicking on the video button next to your name, just as if you were starting the call in the first place.
