## Part 1: How To Use Voice Changer Voicemod For Discord On Desktop Computer

Voicemod is arguably one of the best voice changer tools available on the internet for its excellent features.

But before we jump straight into using Voicemod for Discord, you must know how to install one on your desktop Mac/PC.

### Here's how to install Voicemod

1. Visit the Voicemod website to begin the download process.
2. You'll see the button ‚ÄúGet Voicemod Free‚Äù on the screen. Click it!
3. Upon clicking, the site will ask you to sign in to your account from Discord, Twitch, to Google. Use your Discord login details to sign in.
4. After you're signed in, the ‚Äú.exe‚Äù file will be downloaded to your PC/Mac's download folder. Open the ‚Äú.exe‚Äù file the moment it's downloaded.
5. An install wizard will open up. Navigate through the wizard's installation process to install the program on your PC/Mac.
6. After installation is complete, the installation wizard will ask to restart your windows' Mac or PC.

You can skip it, but it's best to restart it for smooth operations.

Once your Mac/PC restarts, you'll see the Voicemod app icon on your desktop screen.

Now that you have successfully installed the voice changer Voicemod app into your desktop computer, let's dive into knowing **how to use Voicemod on Discord**!

### Here's how to use voice changer on Discord

1. Click the Vociemod icon on the desktop to open the app. If you can't find it there, click the ‚Äúwindows icon‚Äù located at the screen's bottom-left. Just type ‚ÄúVoicemod,‚Äù and the program will show up. Double click it to get it opened.
2. When the app opens up, you'll have to choose the output and input it will use. If you're wondering, why the output? This is to give you an insight into what your voice will sound like on each filter.

Once it's done, you can play around with different filters!

Every day, you'll get new free filters to use; however, to unlock and access all filters, you need to upgrade to the ‚Äúpro-version‚Äù of voice changer Voicemod.

On the other hand, if you only need a few filters, the ‚Äúbasic-version‚Äù should suffice.

Apart from that, you can unlock an additional free filter in your app by sharing it on your social media accounts.

After you have changed settings, you can easily change the voice within the program. Not only this, but other users can also hear your audio alteration.

#### Step 5

With the ‚Äúbasic version,‚Äù you'll have seven free voice choices that will change each day. On the contrary, with the ‚Äúpro-version,‚Äù you'll gain access to more than 80 different voice options.
