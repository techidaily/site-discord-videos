Discord allows for streaming through its Windows desktop client. You can stream games, podcasts, and any other kind of content through it.

5. If you click on the screen, a pop-up window shows up, allowing you to select the application you want to share
6. After setting this up, your friends can join your call by clicking on the General channel

When you want to end the call, click on the red Disconnect icon
