Some people use voice changers because it feels as if they make said people more anonymous. Some trolls use them so that they may harass people more menacingly.

#### 1. [Clownfish](https://clownfish-translator.com/voicechanger/)

![best free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clownfish.jpeg)

The Clownfish voice changer for discord looks a little basic, but it is all worth it to keep things simple. It is not a sophisticated tool, but it does everything right. It would be nice if it had more voices or features but it is not a big problem.

**Pros**

It is freeware and doesn't require a free subscription or account sign-in

Works for all versions of windows

Setup is pretty easy and fast

**Cons**

There are no added voice effects except the custom pitch function

Some voices make certain accents difficult to understand

Has a limited girl voice changer for discord

#### 2. [MorphVOX](https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-free-voice-changer)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/morph-vox.jpeg)

With plenty of features, added effects and built in sounds, this voice changer for discord PC is one of the finest available. It may have made it to the top of this list if it didn't restrict so many of its features to the paid version. The free version is good, but it pales in comparison to the paid process version.

**Pros**

Uses very little bandwidth and CPU power

Has sound effects you can throw into the mix

Custom shortcuts make using this tool easier

**Cons**

Paid subscription version is very expensive

The interface shape looks weird and clunky

Slightly unintuitive install process

#### 3. [VoiceMod](https://www.voicemod.net/voice-changer-demos/)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-mod.jpg)

The voice changing faculties work very well. If you are using this program to change your voice in real time, then it sounds good. If you are using it to change your recorded voice, then it sounds amazing. In fact, if this article were about finding a voice changer for recorded voices, rather than finding a free voice changer for discord live chat, then VoiceMod would win by a significant amount.

**Pros**

The voices you produce sound great

Professionally designed and easy to installs

Flexible with plenty of uses

**Cons**

The free version locks off too many features

App and website needs proofreading for its many written mistakes

Seems to hide paid version until you have actually downloaded

#### 4. [Voxal Voice Changer](https://www.nchsoftware.com/voicechanger/index.html)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voxal-voice-changer.jpg)

On the surface, the Voxal program is the best, but it has its annoying flaws. Installing cleanly is seemingly could be easier, and the program is not difficult to use. However, the free version is very limited. Many of the voices and many of the voice-manipulation tools are locked off from free users.

**Pros**

Has a low CPU usage

The interface is pretty easy to understand

Add effects to live and recorded voices

**Cons**

Compatibility with Steam games is hit and miss

Clean ad-free installs of the free version is tricky

Some voices sound too similar to bother with

#### 5. [Discord Voice Changer](https://apkpure.com/discord-voice-changer/com.oviagames.discordvoicechanger)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-voice-changer-interface.jpg)

This program has an easy-to-use system, and its interface would be lovely if not for a few poorly chosen fonts. The sad part is that this tool is tricky to find, especially if you want a non-Android version. This is because the tool doesn't have its own website, so numerous websites seem to hold it, but they are not easy websites to find.

**Pros**

Connecting with Discord is very easy

Picking a voice is simple and fast

Very low CPU usage

**Cons**

Difficult to install

Finding stable or reliable versions can be tricky

The developer Ovia Games is out of business

#### 6. [Super Voice Changer](http://www.wannengbianshengqi.com/supervoicechanger/)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/super-voice-changer.jpeg)

This is a very lightweight tool, and it uses very little CPU power. But, that shouldn't dissuade you from using it because it has three voices that you can warp and manipulate. The level at which you can manipulate them is very deep. Play with the settings until you find the voice you like, and then save your settings for next time.

**Pros**

Allows for fairly deep customization

Save your settings for easy use next time

Loads quickly and doesn't use much CPU power

**Cons**

Tricky to install correctly

Needs a better help section

Difficult to figure out what some functions do

#### 7. [Audio for Fun](https://www.audio4fun.com/voice-changer.htm)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-for-fun.gif)

The program is pretty advanced, but is more geared towards Skype, which is why it appears so low in this list. Getting your hands on the free version is pretty tricky, but you will find free options on the website. The interface is pretty intuitive to most tech-savvy people.

Pros

The voice morphing tools are pretty advanced

Has various paid and free trial options for flexibility

You can customize the settings for a better output quality

Cons

The three paid versions are unfairly priced

Many functions on this tool will not be used by Discord users

Needs a strong tutorial section

#### 8. [RoboVox Voice Changer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mikrosonic.RoboVoxLite&hl=en%5FGB)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/robovox-voice-changer.jpeg)

This is a fine voice changer that changes your live voice and your recorded voice. The program is let down by how it uses its free services to push its paid in-app functions onto you. Be careful where you download this tool from because there are many websites offering this tool and some of them are offering a malicious download.

**Pros**

The parrot function repeats things back and is funny

Save and share your creations

Three different modes and 32 voice options

**Cons**

The interface looks a little dated

It has in-app purchases that are unfair

The free voices available are very limited

#### 9. [Voice Changer with Effects](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baviux.voicechanger)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-changer-with-effects.jpg)

This tool is actually rather good, but it is rather difficult to get it to work with discord. You need to make it so that the sound output is directed into Discord. Plus, it was custom-made for Smartphones and so looks clunky on desktops.

**Pros**

Has a robust number of voices

Allows you to save your recordings

Pretty easy to understand how it works

**Cons**

Slight lag when changing voices

Wants access to your external storage (your memory card)

Linking it up with Discord is tricky

#### 10. [Voice Changer](https://voicechanger.io/)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-changer-interface.jpg)

Use this program online while you have Discord active. It probably wouldnâ€™t be as low on this list if it didn't make it clearer how to use this with Discord. In short, you have to use the microphone via this website and have the output directed into the Discord system.

**Pros**

Some of the voices sound very funny in a laugh-out-loud way

Many people agree it is a good voice changer for discord

Can use the voices for commercial use without attribution

**Cons**

Getting it to work with Discord is overly difficult

Some of the voices make you impossible to understand

The WTF voice is mostly just your words being jumbled

## How to Choose the Right Free Voice Changer for Discord?

1. **Simple or Professional**

The free voice changer you choose depends upon your needs. If you are looking for something simple and quick, then pick a free open-source program. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to help you record and change your voice, then consider a program that has added paid versions.

1. **What Operation System You Use? Windows, Mac, or More**

The voice changer for Discord Mac versions are a little less common on the Internet. If you are a Mac user, then consider sticking to the app offerings on Apple-moderated marketplaces. Changing your voice for Discord isn't a difficult task, so you should probably stay clear from paid programs if you are a Mac user.

1. **What Voice Effects Do You Want?**

If you are looking for a female voice changer for Discord, then mostly every voice changer will suit you. Every app/program listed on this article has a female voice version. The reason for this is because a female voice is often considered higher pitched and lighter, and such a tone is available through all the apps/programs listed above.

1. **Is It Easy to Get the Tool to Work?**

If you are having a hard time getting the voice changer to work with Discord, then take a look online and especially on YouTube. There are often users on YouTube who have had the same problem and who are showing off a new solution.

If you are really struggling to find a solution, then look for ways to get pre-recorded content into Discord. Usually, the people who offer solutions on Google and Bing to this problem will also have the solution to getting your funny voice changer to work with Discord.

1. **Does it Have a Free Trial?**

One of the primary reasons why shouldn't pay for a voice changer, at least at first, is because there is no guarantee that program will work. It is better if you download and try a free version or use a free trial. That way, if it doesn't work, you haven't lost anything.

Do not be fooled into thinking you have to pay for each tool. Many voice changers will make it seem like their only options are paid versions, but this is often not the case. Even those that do not have a free version will often have a free trial that you can exploit.

## Conclusion - Rating the Free Voice Changers

Since each of the tools on this article are free, there is nothing stopping you from downloading all of them and trying each one. Just be sure you are downloading from a reliable and safe place because some websites host malicious downloads that are not what they say they are.

You may also have a few problems in terms of compatibility. For example, some will only work on Windows devices, or iOS devices, or on Android devices. Though none of the programs listed in this article are iOS only.

Are you a fan of one or more free voice changer for discord? Share this article on social media with your friends and open up a discussion. Let your friends know which tool you are using so they may join you in the funny voice altering fun.

#### 2. [MorphVOX](https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-free-voice-changer)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/morph-vox.jpeg)

With plenty of features, added effects and built in sounds, this voice changer for discord PC is one of the finest available. It may have made it to the top of this list if it didn't restrict so many of its features to the paid version. The free version is good, but it pales in comparison to the paid process version.

**Pros**

Uses very little bandwidth and CPU power

Has sound effects you can throw into the mix

Custom shortcuts make using this tool easier

**Cons**

Paid subscription version is very expensive

The interface shape looks weird and clunky

Slightly unintuitive install process

#### 3. [VoiceMod](https://www.voicemod.net/voice-changer-demos/)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-mod.jpg)

The voice changing faculties work very well. If you are using this program to change your voice in real time, then it sounds good. If you are using it to change your recorded voice, then it sounds amazing. In fact, if this article were about finding a voice changer for recorded voices, rather than finding a free voice changer for discord live chat, then VoiceMod would win by a significant amount.

**Pros**

The voices you produce sound great

Professionally designed and easy to installs

Flexible with plenty of uses

**Cons**

The free version locks off too many features

App and website needs proofreading for its many written mistakes

Seems to hide paid version until you have actually downloaded

#### 4. [Voxal Voice Changer](https://www.nchsoftware.com/voicechanger/index.html)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voxal-voice-changer.jpg)

On the surface, the Voxal program is the best, but it has its annoying flaws. Installing cleanly is seemingly could be easier, and the program is not difficult to use. However, the free version is very limited. Many of the voices and many of the voice-manipulation tools are locked off from free users.

**Pros**

Has a low CPU usage

The interface is pretty easy to understand

Add effects to live and recorded voices

**Cons**

Compatibility with Steam games is hit and miss

Clean ad-free installs of the free version is tricky

Some voices sound too similar to bother with

#### 5. [Discord Voice Changer](https://apkpure.com/discord-voice-changer/com.oviagames.discordvoicechanger)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-voice-changer-interface.jpg)

This program has an easy-to-use system, and its interface would be lovely if not for a few poorly chosen fonts. The sad part is that this tool is tricky to find, especially if you want a non-Android version. This is because the tool doesn't have its own website, so numerous websites seem to hold it, but they are not easy websites to find.

**Pros**

Connecting with Discord is very easy

Picking a voice is simple and fast

Very low CPU usage

**Cons**

Difficult to install

Finding stable or reliable versions can be tricky

The developer Ovia Games is out of business

#### 6. [Super Voice Changer](http://www.wannengbianshengqi.com/supervoicechanger/)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/super-voice-changer.jpeg)

This is a very lightweight tool, and it uses very little CPU power. But, that shouldn't dissuade you from using it because it has three voices that you can warp and manipulate. The level at which you can manipulate them is very deep. Play with the settings until you find the voice you like, and then save your settings for next time.

**Pros**

Allows for fairly deep customization

Save your settings for easy use next time

Loads quickly and doesn't use much CPU power

**Cons**

Tricky to install correctly

Needs a better help section

Difficult to figure out what some functions do

#### 7. [Audio for Fun](https://www.audio4fun.com/voice-changer.htm)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-for-fun.gif)

The program is pretty advanced, but is more geared towards Skype, which is why it appears so low in this list. Getting your hands on the free version is pretty tricky, but you will find free options on the website. The interface is pretty intuitive to most tech-savvy people.

Pros

The voice morphing tools are pretty advanced

Has various paid and free trial options for flexibility

You can customize the settings for a better output quality

Cons

The three paid versions are unfairly priced

Many functions on this tool will not be used by Discord users

Needs a strong tutorial section

#### 8. [RoboVox Voice Changer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mikrosonic.RoboVoxLite&hl=en%5FGB)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/robovox-voice-changer.jpeg)

This is a fine voice changer that changes your live voice and your recorded voice. The program is let down by how it uses its free services to push its paid in-app functions onto you. Be careful where you download this tool from because there are many websites offering this tool and some of them are offering a malicious download.

**Pros**

The parrot function repeats things back and is funny

Save and share your creations

Three different modes and 32 voice options

**Cons**

The interface looks a little dated

It has in-app purchases that are unfair

The free voices available are very limited

#### 9. [Voice Changer with Effects](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baviux.voicechanger)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-changer-with-effects.jpg)

This tool is actually rather good, but it is rather difficult to get it to work with discord. You need to make it so that the sound output is directed into Discord. Plus, it was custom-made for Smartphones and so looks clunky on desktops.

**Pros**

Has a robust number of voices

Allows you to save your recordings

Pretty easy to understand how it works

**Cons**

Slight lag when changing voices

Wants access to your external storage (your memory card)

Linking it up with Discord is tricky

#### 10. [Voice Changer](https://voicechanger.io/)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-changer-interface.jpg)

Use this program online while you have Discord active. It probably wouldnâ€™t be as low on this list if it didn't make it clearer how to use this with Discord. In short, you have to use the microphone via this website and have the output directed into the Discord system.

**Pros**

Some of the voices sound very funny in a laugh-out-loud way

Many people agree it is a good voice changer for discord

Can use the voices for commercial use without attribution

**Cons**

Getting it to work with Discord is overly difficult

Some of the voices make you impossible to understand

The WTF voice is mostly just your words being jumbled

## How to Choose the Right Free Voice Changer for Discord?

1. **Simple or Professional**

The free voice changer you choose depends upon your needs. If you are looking for something simple and quick, then pick a free open-source program. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to help you record and change your voice, then consider a program that has added paid versions.

1. **What Operation System You Use? Windows, Mac, or More**

The voice changer for Discord Mac versions are a little less common on the Internet. If you are a Mac user, then consider sticking to the app offerings on Apple-moderated marketplaces. Changing your voice for Discord isn't a difficult task, so you should probably stay clear from paid programs if you are a Mac user.

1. **What Voice Effects Do You Want?**

If you are looking for a female voice changer for Discord, then mostly every voice changer will suit you. Every app/program listed on this article has a female voice version. The reason for this is because a female voice is often considered higher pitched and lighter, and such a tone is available through all the apps/programs listed above.

1. **Is It Easy to Get the Tool to Work?**

If you are having a hard time getting the voice changer to work with Discord, then take a look online and especially on YouTube. There are often users on YouTube who have had the same problem and who are showing off a new solution.

If you are really struggling to find a solution, then look for ways to get pre-recorded content into Discord. Usually, the people who offer solutions on Google and Bing to this problem will also have the solution to getting your funny voice changer to work with Discord.

1. **Does it Have a Free Trial?**

One of the primary reasons why shouldn't pay for a voice changer, at least at first, is because there is no guarantee that program will work. It is better if you download and try a free version or use a free trial. That way, if it doesn't work, you haven't lost anything.

Do not be fooled into thinking you have to pay for each tool. Many voice changers will make it seem like their only options are paid versions, but this is often not the case. Even those that do not have a free version will often have a free trial that you can exploit.

## Conclusion - Rating the Free Voice Changers

Since each of the tools on this article are free, there is nothing stopping you from downloading all of them and trying each one. Just be sure you are downloading from a reliable and safe place because some websites host malicious downloads that are not what they say they are.

You may also have a few problems in terms of compatibility. For example, some will only work on Windows devices, or iOS devices, or on Android devices. Though none of the programs listed in this article are iOS only.

Are you a fan of one or more free voice changer for discord? Share this article on social media with your friends and open up a discussion. Let your friends know which tool you are using so they may join you in the funny voice altering fun.

For those who do not know, Discord is a free application used for voice and text communication. It is aimed at gamers. The program offers a fair amount of control for people who wish to communicate over groups.

Discord conversations happen with the help of the servers the Discord company offers. Most servers are related to gaming in some way, but you are not limited to just gaming servers and conversations.

## Why Use Voice Changers?

Some people use voice changers because it feels as if they make said people more anonymous. Some trolls use them so that they may harass people more menacingly. Many children use voice changers to hide their age so that they may attend 18+ gaming chats without being blocked. Plus, some people hide their gender using voice changers.

For those who do not know, Discord is a free application used for voice and text communication. It is aimed at gamers. The program offers a fair amount of control for people who wish to communicate over groups.

Discord conversations happen with the help of the servers the Discord company offers. Most servers are related to gaming in some way, but you are not limited to just gaming servers and conversations.

## Why Use Voice Changers?

Some people use voice changers because it feels as if they make said people more anonymous. Some trolls use them so that they may harass people more menacingly. Many children use voice changers to hide their age so that they may attend 18+ gaming chats without being blocked. Plus, some people hide their gender using voice changers.

#### 1. [Clownfish](https://clownfish-translator.com/voicechanger/)

![best free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clownfish.jpeg)

The Clownfish voice changer for discord looks a little basic, but it is all worth it to keep things simple. It is not a sophisticated tool, but it does everything right. It would be nice if it had more voices or features but it is not a big problem.

**Pros**

It is freeware and doesn't require a free subscription or account sign-in

Works for all versions of windows

Setup is pretty easy and fast

**Cons**

There are no added voice effects except the custom pitch function

Some voices make certain accents difficult to understand

Has a limited girl voice changer for discord

#### 2. [MorphVOX](https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-free-voice-changer)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/morph-vox.jpeg)

With plenty of features, added effects and built in sounds, this voice changer for discord PC is one of the finest available. It may have made it to the top of this list if it didn't restrict so many of its features to the paid version. The free version is good, but it pales in comparison to the paid process version.

**Pros**

Uses very little bandwidth and CPU power

Has sound effects you can throw into the mix

Custom shortcuts make using this tool easier

**Cons**

Paid subscription version is very expensive

The interface shape looks weird and clunky

Slightly unintuitive install process

#### 3. [VoiceMod](https://www.voicemod.net/voice-changer-demos/)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-mod.jpg)

The voice changing faculties work very well. If you are using this program to change your voice in real time, then it sounds good. If you are using it to change your recorded voice, then it sounds amazing. In fact, if this article were about finding a voice changer for recorded voices, rather than finding a free voice changer for discord live chat, then VoiceMod would win by a significant amount.

**Pros**

The voices you produce sound great

Professionally designed and easy to installs

Flexible with plenty of uses

**Cons**

The free version locks off too many features

App and website needs proofreading for its many written mistakes

Seems to hide paid version until you have actually downloaded

#### 4. [Voxal Voice Changer](https://www.nchsoftware.com/voicechanger/index.html)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voxal-voice-changer.jpg)

On the surface, the Voxal program is the best, but it has its annoying flaws. Installing cleanly is seemingly could be easier, and the program is not difficult to use. However, the free version is very limited. Many of the voices and many of the voice-manipulation tools are locked off from free users.

**Pros**

Has a low CPU usage

The interface is pretty easy to understand

Add effects to live and recorded voices

**Cons**

Compatibility with Steam games is hit and miss

Clean ad-free installs of the free version is tricky

Some voices sound too similar to bother with

#### 5. [Discord Voice Changer](https://apkpure.com/discord-voice-changer/com.oviagames.discordvoicechanger)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-voice-changer-interface.jpg)

This program has an easy-to-use system, and its interface would be lovely if not for a few poorly chosen fonts. The sad part is that this tool is tricky to find, especially if you want a non-Android version. This is because the tool doesn't have its own website, so numerous websites seem to hold it, but they are not easy websites to find.

**Pros**

Connecting with Discord is very easy

Picking a voice is simple and fast

Very low CPU usage

**Cons**

Difficult to install

Finding stable or reliable versions can be tricky

The developer Ovia Games is out of business

#### 6. [Super Voice Changer](http://www.wannengbianshengqi.com/supervoicechanger/)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/super-voice-changer.jpeg)

This is a very lightweight tool, and it uses very little CPU power. But, that shouldn't dissuade you from using it because it has three voices that you can warp and manipulate. The level at which you can manipulate them is very deep. Play with the settings until you find the voice you like, and then save your settings for next time.

**Pros**

Allows for fairly deep customization

Save your settings for easy use next time

Loads quickly and doesn't use much CPU power

**Cons**

Tricky to install correctly

Needs a better help section

Difficult to figure out what some functions do

#### 7. [Audio for Fun](https://www.audio4fun.com/voice-changer.htm)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-for-fun.gif)

The program is pretty advanced, but is more geared towards Skype, which is why it appears so low in this list. Getting your hands on the free version is pretty tricky, but you will find free options on the website. The interface is pretty intuitive to most tech-savvy people.

Pros

The voice morphing tools are pretty advanced

Has various paid and free trial options for flexibility

You can customize the settings for a better output quality

Cons

The three paid versions are unfairly priced

Many functions on this tool will not be used by Discord users

Needs a strong tutorial section

#### 8. [RoboVox Voice Changer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mikrosonic.RoboVoxLite&hl=en%5FGB)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/robovox-voice-changer.jpeg)

This is a fine voice changer that changes your live voice and your recorded voice. The program is let down by how it uses its free services to push its paid in-app functions onto you. Be careful where you download this tool from because there are many websites offering this tool and some of them are offering a malicious download.

**Pros**

The parrot function repeats things back and is funny

Save and share your creations

Three different modes and 32 voice options

**Cons**

The interface looks a little dated

It has in-app purchases that are unfair

The free voices available are very limited

#### 9. [Voice Changer with Effects](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baviux.voicechanger)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-changer-with-effects.jpg)

This tool is actually rather good, but it is rather difficult to get it to work with discord. You need to make it so that the sound output is directed into Discord. Plus, it was custom-made for Smartphones and so looks clunky on desktops.

**Pros**

Has a robust number of voices

Allows you to save your recordings

Pretty easy to understand how it works

**Cons**

Slight lag when changing voices

Wants access to your external storage (your memory card)

Linking it up with Discord is tricky

#### 10. [Voice Changer](https://voicechanger.io/)

![free voice changer for discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-changer-interface.jpg)

Use this program online while you have Discord active. It probably wouldnâ€™t be as low on this list if it didn't make it clearer how to use this with Discord. In short, you have to use the microphone via this website and have the output directed into the Discord system.

**Pros**

Some of the voices sound very funny in a laugh-out-loud way

Many people agree it is a good voice changer for discord

Can use the voices for commercial use without attribution

**Cons**

Getting it to work with Discord is overly difficult

Some of the voices make you impossible to understand

The WTF voice is mostly just your words being jumbled

## How to Choose the Right Free Voice Changer for Discord?

1. **Simple or Professional**

The free voice changer you choose depends upon your needs. If you are looking for something simple and quick, then pick a free open-source program. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to help you record and change your voice, then consider a program that has added paid versions.

1. **What Operation System You Use? Windows, Mac, or More**

The voice changer for Discord Mac versions are a little less common on the Internet. If you are a Mac user, then consider sticking to the app offerings on Apple-moderated marketplaces. Changing your voice for Discord isn't a difficult task, so you should probably stay clear from paid programs if you are a Mac user.

1. **What Voice Effects Do You Want?**

If you are looking for a female voice changer for Discord, then mostly every voice changer will suit you. Every app/program listed on this article has a female voice version. The reason for this is because a female voice is often considered higher pitched and lighter, and such a tone is available through all the apps/programs listed above.

1. **Is It Easy to Get the Tool to Work?**

If you are having a hard time getting the voice changer to work with Discord, then take a look online and especially on YouTube. There are often users on YouTube who have had the same problem and who are showing off a new solution.

If you are really struggling to find a solution, then look for ways to get pre-recorded content into Discord. Usually, the people who offer solutions on Google and Bing to this problem will also have the solution to getting your funny voice changer to work with Discord.

1. **Does it Have a Free Trial?**

One of the primary reasons why shouldn't pay for a voice changer, at least at first, is because there is no guarantee that program will work. It is better if you download and try a free version or use a free trial. That way, if it doesn't work, you haven't lost anything.

Do not be fooled into thinking you have to pay for each tool. Many voice changers will make it seem like their only options are paid versions, but this is often not the case. Even those that do not have a free version will often have a free trial that you can exploit.

## Conclusion - Rating the Free Voice Changers

Since each of the tools on this article are free, there is nothing stopping you from downloading all of them and trying each one. Just be sure you are downloading from a reliable and safe place because some websites host malicious downloads that are not what they say they are.

You may also have a few problems in terms of compatibility. For example, some will only work on Windows devices, or iOS devices, or on Android devices. Though none of the programs listed in this article are iOS only.

Are you a fan of one or more free voice changer for discord? Share this article on social media with your friends and open up a discussion. Let your friends know which tool you are using so they may join you in the funny voice altering fun.

## The Ideal Chat App for You? Discord Versus Skype Comparison

# Discord Vs. Skype: Which One is Better For You?

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

What would be a catchy but concise way to describe Discord? A modern voice and text communication app that's free.

It's also wildly popular with gamers, secure with DDoS protection, and compatible with desktops as well as mobiles.

And what if you had to describe Skype in a similar manner? An all-in-one app for voice calls, messaging, video conferencing, and file transfer that allows you to connect with others no matter where you are.

Employees need to rely on VoIP apps like Skype and Discord to maintain communication with their colleagues and clients.

You might be wondering which is the better option among the two? Is Skype better than Discord, given that it's more popular and been around for longer?

Or is Discord more secure than Skype? Both these apps have different backgrounds and target different audiences. While Discord is more popular with gamers, Skype is readily used in offices.

Yet, at the same time, both offer similar sets of features that most users require from VoIP apps. So, let's get into discussing which VoIP app is better: Skype or Discord?

## Which Platform Is Better: Discord or Skype?

Our criteria will consider some aspects that are important when discussing communication platforms.

These include Privacy, Security, Sound Quality, Group Calls, Screen Sharing, Call Recording, File Sharing, The Interface, Supported platforms.

### 1. Privacy

Both Skype and Discord can be classified as VoIP apps because of their similar functionalities. However, there are also many differences in their features and who they cater to.

But when considering privacy, both apps seemed to be lacking.

Unfortunately, there have been reports of data breaches from both apps, with users complaining of having their locations and personal data compromised and leaked.

Neither of these apps promises complete privacy, and our recommendation would be to use them in combination with a reliable VPN service.

### 2. Security

Discord offers its users both DDoS and IP address protection, offering full client-to-server security.

On the other hand, Skype was rated poorly for its security but has recently upgraded its measures, hiding user's IP addresses.

### 3. Sound Quality

Discord differs from Skype in its audio-transmission methods and data usage. Skype works much like a phone connection, transmitting audio data continuously, like a phone call. In contrast, Discord only sends audio data when a user speaks during a call.

Both apps differ in their recommended bandwidth, with Skype having an extensive bandwidth of 100 kbps for voice calls and Discord with only 64 kbps in comparison.

For this reason, we would rank Skype higher than Discord for sound quality and audio transmission.

### 4. Group Calls

When comparing the two for group calls, Skype trumps Discord as the better and more widely popular option.

With Skype, users can make group audio and video calls, with as many as 25 people at the same time. On the other hand, Discord limits the number of users who can join a group call to just 10.

Also, Skype allows users to make calls on other phone numbers, including landlines, while Discord only limits calls to other Discord users.

Overall, Skype comes through as a much better choice for group calling.

### 5. Screen Sharing

In this age of remote working, the need for screen-sharing has increased drastically to enhance professional collaboration.

In this regard, both Discord and Skype offer a decent screen-sharing experience.

With Skype, users can [share their screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) even during audio calls, and it is relatively easy to do so, requiring only a single click to start screen-sharing. Plus, it allows users to take a simple screenshot as well.

In comparison, [Discord offers screen-sharing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) options that are more customizable and thorough, with more features for users to benefit from, such as fragmented sharing for people who don't want to share their full screen.

When comparing the two, Discord offers more customization, while Skype offers simple features but is more dependable and convenient. Therefore, Discord edges Skype out by a slight margin for its customizable features.

### 6. Call Recording

Skype has a definitive advantage over Discord in this department, as there is no in-built audio or video recording feature or option in Discord.

Users cannot record calls on Discord, while [Skype does grant a call recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) option for both video and audio calls.

It must be noted that the call recording feature in Skype is a recent addition, after frequent customer complaints about the lack of any call recording option.

It is also relatively simple to do so on Skype; click on the "+" icon and tap on "Start Recording." This procedure works for both the desktop and mobile versions of Skype.

However, Discord users do not need to despair, as there is a way out for their call recording woes:

They can record calls by [installing third-party apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/); however, there have been controversies regarding data breaches through third-party apps, so we'd advise treading with caution.

### 7. File Sharing

Both Discord and Skype allow their users to share multiple files with unlimited users; however, they seem to differ in the file volume that can be shared.

For Skype users, this limit is restricted to files up to 300MB. If the file volume exceeds this limit, the users will be redirected to OneDrive to share with as many users as they want.

Compared to Skype, Discord's file volume limit varies, depending on free users and Nitro users. The file limit for free users is a rather mediocre 8MB, while Nitro users have an ample limit of 50MB.

The monthly subscription for Nitro costs $4.99, so if you're looking for free options, Skype takes the win here.

When considered objectively, the Discord free version is somewhat limiting, and users will need to move onto Discord Nitro if they wish to post pictures or videos.

However, Discord does offer its users external cloud storage platforms. These storage platforms require bots to create shortcuts when exceeding the sharing limit and can be rather tedious. Overall, Skype seems to take the lead in file sharing.

### 8. The Interface

Both Skype and Discord have different interfaces, with Skype following a minimalistic layout and interface from its inception.

Since then, it has incorporated new updates and additions to account for new features that boost the user experience.

![Skype Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-interface.jpg)

Skype has traditionally been considered a business tool, ideal for making landline and international calls, with perfect compatibility with most business apps.

On the other hand, Discord is not as easy to use as Skype because of its more complex layout.

Discord, unlike Skype, is much more than a VoIP app. The gaming community relies on it to stream gaming sessions; online fan clubs also use it to share content among their communities.

Instead of just an app used to make calls, Discords presents itself as a forum for peers to hang out online.

![Discord Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

Additionally, due to its tilt towards the gaming community, Discord includes a unique feature, where each time a user makes a call, they are assigned a server. Other users can join this server without the original users having to leave their game.

This way, gamers can display their gaming skills to others in real-time. These calls are called drop-in calls and require no invites, meaning you can chat with anyone without them being your friend inside a server.

Due to its enhanced useability, Discord wins this category!

### 9. Supported Platforms

In this regard, Discord wins over Skype with a considerable lead. Discord allows users to sync with Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Steam, and many other apps, making it easy to find friends and families and connect with them.

It even allows you to check what music your friends are listening to on Spotify!

In contrast, Skype is considerably limited as it only syncs with Facebook. However, its value lies in its compatibility with business apps, notably Docs, Excel, and Powerpoint, as well as polls and whiteboard.

Recently, you will find Skype Business to be included in the Office 365 Suite, costing $8.99 as a whole.

## Skype Vs. Discord: Which One Should You Choose?

These apps deliver much of the essential features that users expect from top VoIP apps, yet they cater to different sets of users.

While Skype allows you to make mobile and landline calls by buying credit online, Discord limits itself to only app-to-app communications.

Skype also offers bots that can be found using the search option. These bots include games and music bots, but compared to Discord, they're somewhat limited.

Discord's bots keep in spirit with its gaming audience and include a diverse range of features, including some that allow you to play games, play music or create memes.

In contrast, Skype is considerably business-oriented, allowing you to host large meetings with 250 participants.

All in all, both of these apps offer unique features for their intended audiences. How useful you find each app depends on the category you belong to.

If you're a gamer who likes to connect with other gamers or stream videos, Discord is the choice for you. However, if you are a business professional looking to host video conferences, Skype is the better option.

In case that you want to record the desktop screen and the audio simultaneously, you should try Wondershare Filmora, which provides both the recording and editing tools.

For this reason, we would rank Skype higher than Discord for sound quality and audio transmission.

### 4. Group Calls

When comparing the two for group calls, Skype trumps Discord as the better and more widely popular option.

With Skype, users can make group audio and video calls, with as many as 25 people at the same time. On the other hand, Discord limits the number of users who can join a group call to just 10.

Also, Skype allows users to make calls on other phone numbers, including landlines, while Discord only limits calls to other Discord users.

Overall, Skype comes through as a much better choice for group calling.

### 5. Screen Sharing

In this age of remote working, the need for screen-sharing has increased drastically to enhance professional collaboration.

In this regard, both Discord and Skype offer a decent screen-sharing experience.

With Skype, users can [share their screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) even during audio calls, and it is relatively easy to do so, requiring only a single click to start screen-sharing. Plus, it allows users to take a simple screenshot as well.

In comparison, [Discord offers screen-sharing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) options that are more customizable and thorough, with more features for users to benefit from, such as fragmented sharing for people who don't want to share their full screen.

When comparing the two, Discord offers more customization, while Skype offers simple features but is more dependable and convenient. Therefore, Discord edges Skype out by a slight margin for its customizable features.

### 6. Call Recording

Skype has a definitive advantage over Discord in this department, as there is no in-built audio or video recording feature or option in Discord.

Users cannot record calls on Discord, while [Skype does grant a call recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) option for both video and audio calls.

It must be noted that the call recording feature in Skype is a recent addition, after frequent customer complaints about the lack of any call recording option.

It is also relatively simple to do so on Skype; click on the "+" icon and tap on "Start Recording." This procedure works for both the desktop and mobile versions of Skype.

However, Discord users do not need to despair, as there is a way out for their call recording woes:

They can record calls by [installing third-party apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/); however, there have been controversies regarding data breaches through third-party apps, so we'd advise treading with caution.

### 7. File Sharing

Both Discord and Skype allow their users to share multiple files with unlimited users; however, they seem to differ in the file volume that can be shared.

For Skype users, this limit is restricted to files up to 300MB. If the file volume exceeds this limit, the users will be redirected to OneDrive to share with as many users as they want.

Compared to Skype, Discord's file volume limit varies, depending on free users and Nitro users. The file limit for free users is a rather mediocre 8MB, while Nitro users have an ample limit of 50MB.

The monthly subscription for Nitro costs $4.99, so if you're looking for free options, Skype takes the win here.

When considered objectively, the Discord free version is somewhat limiting, and users will need to move onto Discord Nitro if they wish to post pictures or videos.

However, Discord does offer its users external cloud storage platforms. These storage platforms require bots to create shortcuts when exceeding the sharing limit and can be rather tedious. Overall, Skype seems to take the lead in file sharing.

### 8. The Interface

Both Skype and Discord have different interfaces, with Skype following a minimalistic layout and interface from its inception.

Since then, it has incorporated new updates and additions to account for new features that boost the user experience.

![Skype Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-interface.jpg)

Skype has traditionally been considered a business tool, ideal for making landline and international calls, with perfect compatibility with most business apps.

On the other hand, Discord is not as easy to use as Skype because of its more complex layout.

Discord, unlike Skype, is much more than a VoIP app. The gaming community relies on it to stream gaming sessions; online fan clubs also use it to share content among their communities.

Instead of just an app used to make calls, Discords presents itself as a forum for peers to hang out online.

![Discord Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-user-settings.jpg)

Additionally, due to its tilt towards the gaming community, Discord includes a unique feature, where each time a user makes a call, they are assigned a server. Other users can join this server without the original users having to leave their game.

This way, gamers can display their gaming skills to others in real-time. These calls are called drop-in calls and require no invites, meaning you can chat with anyone without them being your friend inside a server.

Due to its enhanced useability, Discord wins this category!

### 9. Supported Platforms

In this regard, Discord wins over Skype with a considerable lead. Discord allows users to sync with Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Steam, and many other apps, making it easy to find friends and families and connect with them.

It even allows you to check what music your friends are listening to on Spotify!

In contrast, Skype is considerably limited as it only syncs with Facebook. However, its value lies in its compatibility with business apps, notably Docs, Excel, and Powerpoint, as well as polls and whiteboard.

Recently, you will find Skype Business to be included in the Office 365 Suite, costing $8.99 as a whole.

## Skype Vs. Discord: Which One Should You Choose?

These apps deliver much of the essential features that users expect from top VoIP apps, yet they cater to different sets of users.

While Skype allows you to make mobile and landline calls by buying credit online, Discord limits itself to only app-to-app communications.

Skype also offers bots that can be found using the search option. These bots include games and music bots, but compared to Discord, they're somewhat limited.

Discord's bots keep in spirit with its gaming audience and include a diverse range of features, including some that allow you to play games, play music or create memes.

In contrast, Skype is considerably business-oriented, allowing you to host large meetings with 250 participants.

All in all, both of these apps offer unique features for their intended audiences. How useful you find each app depends on the category you belong to.

If you're a gamer who likes to connect with other gamers or stream videos, Discord is the choice for you. However, if you are a business professional looking to host video conferences, Skype is the better option.

In case that you want to record the desktop screen and the audio simultaneously, you should try Wondershare Filmora, which provides both the recording and editing tools.

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

What would be a catchy but concise way to describe Discord? A modern voice and text communication app that's free.

It's also wildly popular with gamers, secure with DDoS protection, and compatible with desktops as well as mobiles.

And what if you had to describe Skype in a similar manner? An all-in-one app for voice calls, messaging, video conferencing, and file transfer that allows you to connect with others no matter where you are.

Employees need to rely on VoIP apps like Skype and Discord to maintain communication with their colleagues and clients.

You might be wondering which is the better option among the two? Is Skype better than Discord, given that it's more popular and been around for longer?

Or is Discord more secure than Skype? Both these apps have different backgrounds and target different audiences. While Discord is more popular with gamers, Skype is readily used in offices.

Yet, at the same time, both offer similar sets of features that most users require from VoIP apps. So, let's get into discussing which VoIP app is better: Skype or Discord?

## Which Platform Is Better: Discord or Skype?

Our criteria will consider some aspects that are important when discussing communication platforms.

These include Privacy, Security, Sound Quality, Group Calls, Screen Sharing, Call Recording, File Sharing, The Interface, Supported platforms.

### 1. Privacy

Both Skype and Discord can be classified as VoIP apps because of their similar functionalities. However, there are also many differences in their features and who they cater to.

But when considering privacy, both apps seemed to be lacking.

Unfortunately, there have been reports of data breaches from both apps, with users complaining of having their locations and personal data compromised and leaked.

Neither of these apps promises complete privacy, and our recommendation would be to use them in combination with a reliable VPN service.

### 2. Security

Discord offers its users both DDoS and IP address protection, offering full client-to-server security.

On the other hand, Skype was rated poorly for its security but has recently upgraded its measures, hiding user's IP addresses.

Discord differs from Skype in its audio-transmission methods and data usage. Skype works much like a phone connection, transmitting audio data continuously, like a phone call. In contrast, Discord only sends audio data when a user speaks during a call.
