 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

With Discord, you can [text with emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and even send GIFs. However, as servers become crowded, they get bombarded with texts. And some of these texts have spoilers for games (or other stuff) that others may not want to know or read. But ignoring spoilers was not that easy. As you scroll miles and miles of texts, your eyes are bound to catch some hints and ruin the suspense for you.

Thankfully, Discord came out with the perfect solution. Now, if you are sharing some spoilers or secrets, you can mark them as spoilers. The result is a text that is sent but is blacked out. Curious users who are not scared of spoilers can view it. Others can enjoy their bliss of ignorance.

## Part 1: How to Use Spoilers on Discord to Hide Text Messages?

And now we come to the point - **how to do spoilers on Discord**? Well, there are two ways to do it. You can run through both of them and choose whichever suits you the best. All the methods are simple to follow. Note that some are available only on the desktop.

### Method 1: Adding Spoiler Text Via Tag on Discord

We will begin with the tag method. All you have to do is add the spoiler tag on Discord. Here is a quick rundown of the steps –

1. Open the Discord app and log in using your credentials.
2. Pick a server from your server list or a friend from the friend list.
3. Type whatever you want to in the chatbox.
4. Now add the ‘||’ symbols before and after the spoiler content. For instance, it will look something like this – Hey! This is a spoiler ||spoiler alert||
5. Hit the enter key to send and your spoiler is sent without spoiling anything!

![add spoiler tag to Discord  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoiler-tag-discord.jpg)

This works for the Discord desktop app, browser, and also mobile app. This is like a universal method of hiding spoilers.

You can also add ‘/spoiler’ before the spoiler content. This is an alternative to the ‘||’ we add at the start and the end.

![add spoiler tag slash to Discord ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoiler-tag-slash-discord.jpg)

### Method 2: Sending Spoiler Message with Mark as Spoiler icon

This alternate method is quite simple. This was a recent update on Discord that enables you to add the spoiler tag quickly. Here is a brief rundown for you –

1. Type out the spoiler content in the chatbox.
2. Select the spoiler part of the text (highlight it).
3. Upon selection, a floating bar will appear. Click the ‘eye’ symbol. and then the '||' mark will immediately accompany the selected text, and the selected message will be spoiled automatically.
4. After you hit the send button, the text will be sent to the server. Only the people who wish to see the spoiler will tap on it unveil it.

![add spoiler marker on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoiler-icon.jpg)

This method is available only on the Discord desktop app and browser version. For iOS, the steps are similar. The only difference is that you have to select the spoiler mark from the context menu.

## Part 2: How to Add Spoiler to Image and Video on Discord?

There are many scenarios where a **Discord spoiler** can come in handy. As you might be aware that Discord is quite popular and its cross-platform flexibility make it a favorite among gamers. You can connect to your friends over multiple devices with a single account.

Just like texts, even images, videos, and other attachments can be marked as spoilers. The process of marking images and videos as spoilers differs slightly from that of texts. So, how to add spoiler tags to other files? Here’s the rundown.

![add spoiler to image and video on Discord  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoilers-to-image-video.jpg)

Images can be tagged as spoilers before you upload them on servers. To add spoiler tags to images –

* Open Discord on your desktop app or browser.
* Select the image or video that you want to send on the server.
* Drag it to your server chat and drop it there.
* Next, tap on the ‘+’ symbol.
* From the options that appear, choose 'Mark as Spoiler.'
* Hit the Upload button.
* The result is a blurred image sent on the server. Anyone who wishes to view the image can tap on it.

Note that spoilers that contain images, videos, or other multimedia files can be sent only on the desktop app or the browser. Mobile apps do not support spoiler marks for images or other media files.

## Bonus: Is it the same to use Spoiler on Mobile devices?

The **Discord mobile spoiler** tag works the same on mobile apps. The process is more or less the same. Here is a quick rundown of the steps –

1. Type out the spoiler text.
2. Add ‘||’ symbols at the start and end of the text you want to hide.
3. Hit the send button, and your spoiler text will be covered.
4. Only the curious ones can tap and see your spoiler texts.

You can even mark embedded links as spoilers with the same process. But this does not apply to Discord server links. Furthermore, **you cannot add spoiler tags to images, videos, and other files from the mobile app.**

For iOS, you can select and highlight the text that you want to hide. Then, tap open the context menu and click on the ‘Mark as Spoiler’ to hide the text.

## Bonus: How to turn off the Spoiler tag?

For some reason, you may want to remove the spoiler tag from the spoiler texts. In that case, open the User Settings and tap on Text & Images. Scroll down to the Show Spoiler Content tab and you will see options to control when spoiler content is displayed. You can choose to display on click, on servers I moderate, and always.

If you want to display all spoiler content, choose Always to turn off the spoiler tag. You can hide them again through the same menu if you change your mind.

![turn off spoiler on Discord  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-off-spoiler-feature-discord.jpg)

Images can be tagged as spoilers before you upload them on servers. To add spoiler tags to images –

* Open Discord on your desktop app or browser.
* Select the image or video that you want to send on the server.
* Drag it to your server chat and drop it there.
* Next, tap on the ‘+’ symbol.
* From the options that appear, choose 'Mark as Spoiler.'
* Hit the Upload button.
* The result is a blurred image sent on the server. Anyone who wishes to view the image can tap on it.

Note that spoilers that contain images, videos, or other multimedia files can be sent only on the desktop app or the browser. Mobile apps do not support spoiler marks for images or other media files.

## Bonus: Is it the same to use Spoiler on Mobile devices?

The **Discord mobile spoiler** tag works the same on mobile apps. The process is more or less the same. Here is a quick rundown of the steps –

1. Type out the spoiler text.
2. Add ‘||’ symbols at the start and end of the text you want to hide.
3. Hit the send button, and your spoiler text will be covered.
4. Only the curious ones can tap and see your spoiler texts.

You can even mark embedded links as spoilers with the same process. But this does not apply to Discord server links. Furthermore, **you cannot add spoiler tags to images, videos, and other files from the mobile app.**

For iOS, you can select and highlight the text that you want to hide. Then, tap open the context menu and click on the ‘Mark as Spoiler’ to hide the text.

## Bonus: How to turn off the Spoiler tag?

For some reason, you may want to remove the spoiler tag from the spoiler texts. In that case, open the User Settings and tap on Text & Images. Scroll down to the Show Spoiler Content tab and you will see options to control when spoiler content is displayed. You can choose to display on click, on servers I moderate, and always.

If you want to display all spoiler content, choose Always to turn off the spoiler tag. You can hide them again through the same menu if you change your mind.

This was an article on **how to use the Discord spoiler tag** to hide texts, images, and videos. You can undo and redo the tags as many times as you like. If you are about to unveil some life-changing secret on your Discord server, then don’t forget to add that spoiler tag.

With Discord, you can [text with emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and even send GIFs. However, as servers become crowded, they get bombarded with texts. And some of these texts have spoilers for games (or other stuff) that others may not want to know or read. But ignoring spoilers was not that easy. As you scroll miles and miles of texts, your eyes are bound to catch some hints and ruin the suspense for you.

Thankfully, Discord came out with the perfect solution. Now, if you are sharing some spoilers or secrets, you can mark them as spoilers. The result is a text that is sent but is blacked out. Curious users who are not scared of spoilers can view it. Others can enjoy their bliss of ignorance.

## Part 1: How to Use Spoilers on Discord to Hide Text Messages?

And now we come to the point - **how to do spoilers on Discord**? Well, there are two ways to do it. You can run through both of them and choose whichever suits you the best. All the methods are simple to follow. Note that some are available only on the desktop.

### Method 1: Adding Spoiler Text Via Tag on Discord

1. Open the Discord app and log in using your credentials.
2. Pick a server from your server list or a friend from the friend list.
3. Type whatever you want to in the chatbox.
4. Now add the ‘||’ symbols before and after the spoiler content. For instance, it will look something like this – Hey! This is a spoiler ||spoiler alert||
5. Hit the enter key to send and your spoiler is sent without spoiling anything!

![add spoiler tag to Discord  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoiler-tag-discord.jpg)

This works for the Discord desktop app, browser, and also mobile app. This is like a universal method of hiding spoilers.

You can also add ‘/spoiler’ before the spoiler content. This is an alternative to the ‘||’ we add at the start and the end.

![add spoiler tag slash to Discord ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-spoiler-tag-slash-discord.jpg)

### Method 2: Sending Spoiler Message with Mark as Spoiler icon

This alternate method is quite simple. This was a recent update on Discord that enables you to add the spoiler tag quickly. Here is a brief rundown for you –

1. Type out the spoiler content in the chatbox.
2. Select the spoiler part of the text (highlight it).
3. Upon selection, a floating bar will appear. Click the ‘eye’ symbol. and then the '||' mark will immediately accompany the selected text, and the selected message will be spoiled automatically.

## Part 2: How to Add Spoiler to Image and Video on Discord?

There are many scenarios where a **Discord spoiler** can come in handy. As you might be aware that Discord is quite popular and its cross-platform flexibility make it a favorite among gamers. You can connect to your friends over multiple devices with a single account.
