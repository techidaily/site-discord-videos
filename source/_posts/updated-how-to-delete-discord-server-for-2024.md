Discord servers are made and designed to help gamers – and now work colleagues – communicate and coordinate via private rooms.

As a communication app, it offers permanent servers for people who are working on the same project, playing the same game, or even if they're part of the same family!

However, you may have to someday delete a server you own.

Today we will discuss **how to delete Discord server** or deleting the Discord server of someone who has passed away:

## Part 1: How to Delete Discord Server Permanently on A Desktop?

If you're familiar with Discord, you will know that there will come a time that you no longer need a server: it may be because you've resigned from your workplace or stopped playing a game.

If you are looking into **how to delete your Discord server**, you came to the right place. Even though Discord makes communication easier, you may need a break from around-the-clock connectivity for various reasons.

Discord works on desktop platforms and smartphones, with a blend of a VoIP chat system, a chat lobby, and a message board in a single app. Therefore, you can attempt to delete a server off on any device that you may have Discord downloaded and active on.

Most server owners choose to delete their Discord server when too many extra, strange, or ill-meaning visitors are visiting.

Servers are more like chat rooms inside the application. Deleting them is a relatively simple process – as you will learn from our **how to delete server on Discord** tips – however, their retrieval is impossible.

Once the server has been removed, you can not "undo the process" or recreate it. Therefore, be absolutely sure and proceed with caution.

It is also advised to skim through any essential files that you might have on the server. Back them up before letting it go forever.

And lastly, ensure that this is what you intend on doing because deleting a Discord server is permanent. Here are the simple steps to follow on **how to delete a server on Discord**:

1. Open the Discord desktop app and click on the server you want to delete
2. Once you select the server, there will be an options list under the server's name
3. Click the "server setting" button from the menu (This will be the second option on the list)

**Image**: _The image shows the screen that pops up after clicking "Server settings," here, the delete button can be seen in red._

1. After clicking, a pop-up window will appear, asking for confirmation
2. Confirm by entering the server's name and authentication code; this is only required when two-factor authentication is enabled
3. Click on "delete server" to confirm

![ Discord Server delete confirm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/double-confirm-to-delete-server.jpg)

**Image:** _As mentioned, you must be sure you want to permanently lose a server and all of its content before deleting it; this prompt serves the same purpose_

You can also transfer your server's ownership to another individual if you do not want to delete it. To do this:

1. Open server settings and then select "Members" in the left sidebar
2. A list of every server member will open, hover over the person's name that you want to transfer ownership to, and then click the three dots appearing on the right

1. Select "Transfer Ownership" and then confirm the transfer.

## How to Delete A Server On Discord Via The Mobile App?

Suppose you do not want to go through the hassle of logging on to the desktop app. In that case, you have the option of deleting your Discord server via the mobile app quickly.

Here are some easy to follow steps on **how to delete Discord server** using the mobile app:

1. Open the Discord app on your Android device or iPhone and then tap the hamburger settings icon on the top-left
2. Search for the server you wish to delete, and then long-press the icon of the server you chose
3. A mini option bar will pop up; here, you must click on "More Options" and then the server options will slide up on your screen; click on "Settings" to continue.
4. This will take you to the control panel; here, click on the three-dotted settings on the top right
5. Now you will be provided only one option: "Delete (server name)." Click on it

At this point, in the **how to delete server on Discord** process, Discord will ask you why you chose to delete the server as part of their customer experience surveys.

It is nothing but a formality; choosing to ignore it or answer it will not affect the process's outcome.

You can choose from pre-decided answers as well, and to give you an example, one of the options is: "I couldn't get people to join."

### How Do I Delete A Discord Server Without Ownership?

Previously you could delete your Discord server using a BOT. Anyone who had permission to use the command/action within BOT could also delete the server. However, now only the server owner and the Discord trust and safety team can delete a server.

# Best Discord Alternatives for Better Experience

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord is a communication software that allows users, mostly gamers, to communicate in real-time with clear lag-free voice chat and text chat and exchange information. It is available for free but requires you to buy Discord-Nitro to access more features.

## **Part 1: Why You Should Try A Discord Alternative?**

Although Discord is an amazing application and used by the majority of the player base, professionals and even by companies for corporate meetings. There are some points due to which one might prefer something different than what discord has to offer as its main focus is to provide ease for all kinds of gamers.

Here are some reasons that might cause you to look at other alternatives:

* Server Raids
* Less Free File Transfer Size
* Not So Professional UI
* Less Specific Profile Editing
* No Self Hosting
* And more.

## **Part 2: Best Discord Alternative Programs You Should Try**

There is a wide market of programs that can provide you the same features as Discord or features that aren’t in Discord but you need. Below is a list of programs that you can try to find perfect one for you.

### **Discord Alternatives Best For Gamer Chatting**

#### 1  TeamSpeak

TeamSpeak is a proprietary voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) application for audio communication between users on a voice channel, very almost like a call. Users typically use headphones with a microphone. It has been around since 2002 and hence is widely trusted by the community.

![discord alternative for gamers - teamspeak](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/teamspeak-audio-communication-app.jpg)

It allows crystal clear and lag free communication with 3D immersive features that help gamers who play real simulation games like Arma 3 to feel more involved with the radio feature and more. TeamSpeak is available on Window, Mac and on Mobile Devices.

Some of the advantages that TeamSpeak offers that make it better than the rest are:

* Spam Free
* Military Grade Encryption
* Host Private Servers
* Access over 100 add-ons, skins and voice packs
* Cloud-based service that enables you to synchronize your servers, settings, and preferences between devices with ease
* Won’t Provide Your Data to Third Parties
* 3D User Immersive Positioning

You can read more about it’s advantages at: <https://teamspeak.com/en/features/overview/>

#### 2 Mumble

Mumble is a voice IP application primarily designed to be employed by gamers and is analogous to programs like TeamSpeak. Mumble uses a client–server architecture which allows users to speak to each other via an equivalent server. It has a really simple administrative interface and features high sound quality and low latency. It has been around since 2005 but they released the stable version in October 2020.

![discord alternative for gamers - Mumble](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mumble-public-server-list.jpg)

Mumble is quite similar to TeamSpeak in it’s features and abilities. But in addition to that, it provides a large list of features separate to each kind of user from End-users to Hosters.

Users use Mumble for realism with their positional audio. This means that the farther one is, the more difficult it would be to receive their audio signals. And so Eve Online Players have servers with almost 100 active voice participants at a time. Mumbleis available on Window, Mac and on Mobile Devices.

Some more advantages that Mumble offers are:

* Low Latency - Great for Gaming
* Privacy - Always Encrypted Communication
* Open Source
* Extensive User Permission System (ACL)
* Free Software - No Licensing or Cost (even for Hosters)

You can read more about Mumble at: <https://www.mumble.info>

#### 3  Ventrilo

Ventrilo 4.0 is that subsequent evolutionary step of voice IP (VoIP) group communications software. Ventrilo is additionally the industry standard by which all others plan to emulate.

By offering surround sound and special sound effects on a per user, per channel level, the program provides each User the choice to completely customize sounds from other Users or events.

![discord alternative for gamers - Ventrilo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ventrilo-interface.jpg)

Ventrilo is best known for its superior sound quality and minimal use of CPU resources so as to not interfere with normal operations of the pc or during online game competitions. It is also preferred for the straightforward interface that any first time person can very quickly learn because the foremost commonly used features are immediately visible and can be activated with one click of the mouse.

Ventrilo uses a client-server based connection that's always encrypted. User data isn't collected or stored, hence it can't be shared/sold to external entities. All text-chat communications/audio-recordings are stored locally on the Client computer. Ventrilo is available on Windows, Mac and even Linux. As for mobile users, it’s available on Apple Store and also for android but android users will have to download an APK which can be done from its website.

Some Advantages that Ventrilo provides over Discord are:

* A great Discord alternative which boasts of low latency voice calls with a light-weight design
* All text-chat communications/audio-recordings and other data is stored locally on the Users computer
* Data-centers provides for security, power backup and good internet speeds

You can read more about Ventrilo at their official Website at: <https://www.ventrilo.com>

### **Best Discord Alternatives for Corporate and Professional Use**

#### 1  Troop Messenger

Troop Messenger is a simple to use and high functioning Team Communication and Project Scheduling software. It provides many features that are made for businesses and corporate companies to stay professional and keep their privacy to themselves.
