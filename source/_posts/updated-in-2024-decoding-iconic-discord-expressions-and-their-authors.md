## Part 3: FAQs About Discord Bots

### 1. Is it safe to use Discord Bots?

If the bot is simply added to a server there's little they will do. Worst case it posts a link containing something dodgy but none of the large bots will do this and you'd still need to open the link first.

Self-hosted potentially could contain something nasty but they're all open source so you'll see exactly what they are doing. albeit you do not understand coding, just accompany a recommended one.

To summarise:

\-Added to the server: Almost nothing they will do and therefore the big ones won't roll in the hay.

\-Self-hosted: These could contain something nasty but accompany recommended ones and you will be fine.

### 2. Is there an Official Discord Bot?

No, Discord has no official bot. All the bots are created by developers and the community. Bots are just programmed user profiles and can be programmed in any way to promote a certain type and number of features.

### 3. How Many Bots are there on Discord?

On Discord, users can communicate by directly messaging another user or creating a group chat. But the most common and best way is to create servers where everyone gets together and has fun.

To manage these servers and the members, and to provide more facilities, there are a lot of bots that provide a variety of features from user management to entertainment and music and more.

Adding a music bot to your server is very simple and only takes one click. Just go to the Website of whatever Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.

Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.

After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members in the server.

## Part 3: FAQs About Discord Bots

### 1. Is it safe to use Discord Bots?

If the bot is simply added to a server there's little they will do. Worst case it posts a link containing something dodgy but none of the large bots will do this and you'd still need to open the link first.

Self-hosted potentially could contain something nasty but they're all open source so you'll see exactly what they are doing. albeit you do not understand coding, just accompany a recommended one.

To summarise:

\-Added to the server: Almost nothing they will do and therefore the big ones won't roll in the hay.

\-Self-hosted: These could contain something nasty but accompany recommended ones and you will be fine.

### 2. Is there an Official Discord Bot?

No, Discord has no official bot. All the bots are created by developers and the community. Bots are just programmed user profiles and can be programmed in any way to promote a certain type and number of features.

### 3. How Many Bots are there on Discord?

Discord Bots is growing, holding a library of over six thousand bots developed by over 10,000 developers currently in use, with new ones shooting up a day. Thousands of Discord users are hitting the Discord Bots site monthly to feature bots to their servers.
