##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Emojis have been trending for quite some time now, especially on [Discord](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). They've become an integral part of our communication because they can make our messages more expressive and less dull.

The popularity of emojis over Discord has grown so much that many users now want to make their own. Hundreds of online websites and mobile applications have surfaced for this purpose.

While making an emoji may seem daunting at first, this blog is here to guide you to the best tools to help you do it just the way you want it.

## Best Free Online Discord Emoji Makers

Is there anything better than a free website that allows you to create an emoji to express your true feelings in your own style?

Here are three free Discord emoji maker online tools you might want to try out:

### 1\.  Kapwing

[Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/explore/128x128-custom-discord-emote-maker) is a custom Discord emote maker that provides you with all the necessary tools and features required to make an emoji.

Remember, Discord has a strict image size policy, so set your image to 128x128 pixels when building your emoji.

The layout allows you to edit your picture and turn it into a Discord emote easily, ensuring that it's the right size and dimensions. The tool also provides you with various options to make your emoji just the way you want it.

Once you've made your emoji all that is left is to upload it to your Discord server. Here's how to do that:

* Head up to your server where you want to upload the emoji,
* Select the down-arrow next to the server's name in the Discord screen's top-left corner.
* You'll find an option of server settings; choosing would lead you to a list of other options.
* Select the Emojis options in the left sidebar
* Click on the "Upload Emoji" bar.

To know more about getting and adding emojis to your Discord server, [read this](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/how-to-make-discord-emotes/).

## Best Discord Emoji Making Apps for iPhone and Android

The good thing about Discord is that it's for everyone, regardless of the platform, device, or OS they may be using.

These Discord emoji maker applications are easy to use, intelligently designed, and, best of all, can be used on both iPhone and Android devices:

### 1\.  BITMOJI

With over 3 million downloads, Bitmoji is a top-rated application that's also linked with Snapchat.

It is the go-to app for teenagers and is considered one of the best and most popular third-party applications over the last year.

 The highly-customizable emojis created via this app could be your alter-egos because you can make them look just like you, making conversing highly interactive and fun.

Using Bitmoji is easy and straightforward. While the application earlier required you to create an avatar or an emoji from scratch, it now offers the option of selecting a picture and generating emojis and stickers.

 You can make changes or adjustments to your emoji if it's not what you imagined it to be. You may do this by directly customizing the appearance of your avatar. That includes changing hair, color, size or shape, and much more.

Furthermore, with Bitmoji you can:

* Create an expressive avatar
* Choose from a vast library of emojis

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\.  ZMOJI

This application is the perfect fit for you if you want to create and easily share customizable emojis with your friends. This is also used as a Discord emoji maker, but it may remind old users of the Bitmoji application, where you had no automated guidance.

You were left clear to experiment and use your creativity to start in and make emojis for yourself from scratch.

There is almost nothing in the application that you are not able to adjust.

This includes changing or adjusting the avatar features such as eyebrows and hairstyle to face type and clothing.

Once you've created ZMoji emojis for yourself, you can download them and send them over to your Discord server for upload.

ZMoji keyboard, an extension of the ZMoji application, is a must if you love animated emojis. It offers an extensive range of stickers, and you won't run out of options anytime soon.

However, some users might find that the biggest drawback of ZMoji is the number of ads on the platform and that the cost of a premium subscription is a touch more expensive.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![discord emoji maker on mobile - ZMOJI](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/discord-emoji-maker-5.jpg)

### 3\.  EMOJILY

Another exciting Discord emote maker application that works as an emoji maker is Emojily.

The application offers several different designs to make your unique emoji and emoticon. You can label your emojis in many categories and find the perfect features such as eyes, eyebrows, mouths, hands, clothes, and even hats.

Users also appreciate the ability to directly share it to other platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Kik, or upload it to your Discord server is appreciated by users.

The standout feature of Emojly is a feature that they term a super feature called the randomize feature. It is designed to act as an automated super crazy creator and maker! This feature generates random emojis based on the labels decided by you. Pretty cool, right?

With Emojily, you have all the tools available to run your creativity wild and make the best emoji present.

While The Create Emoji is a free, customized extension of Emojily, you can only access limited elements in the free version. You may wish to subscribe to the paid version to establish more control over the design. Doing this will allow you to enjoy the more extensive experience Emojily has to offer.
