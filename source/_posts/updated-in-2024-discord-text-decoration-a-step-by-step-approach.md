 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord is a brand name that many people have heard about, and this instant messaging and content distribution service is rapidly gaining popularity among many groups of users. A unique feature of this platform is that it facilitates community-based communication, where users who share certain interests can form their own private chats that are known as servers.

While its user interface is quite simple, Discord allows users to deploy a variety of advanced communication tools, from textual content to audio and video streams. It’s natural that users want to express their thoughts creatively, so there is a lot of genuine interest in learning how to change the visual look of the messages through the use of basic text formatting. In this article, we will discuss how to change text style in Discord and provide detailed instructions for activating various options, such as using bold or italic letters or underlining a part of the text.

Let’s start with the software module that makes it all possible.

## Part 1: How Does Discord Text Engine Work?

Beneath the surface, Discord runs on a powerful engine called Markdown, which regulates how text is displayed on the pages visible to users. It’s an application of markup language that completely depends on textual symbols as commands, making it quite simple for users who are not skilled at advanced programming to alter the look of the text.

Basically, Markdown allows you to enter a few symbols and it will interpret them as commands for changing the text style, for example bolding or underlying certain word or sentence. For highlighting blocks of text, there is a specific library named [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) that allows simple text marking for stylistic emphasis.

This approach is very practical and easy to learn, so long-time users of Discord are able to change text style as they type without thinking too much about it. Really, it’s all about following a couple of simple rules and knowing the most important combinations of characters (tags).

## Part 2: How to Change Text Style in Discord with Markdown?

As we mentioned previously, Markdown is completely text-based and has a very simple syntax. All you need to do to apply special formatting to your text is to enter a few special characters at the right places, and the appropriate effect (bold, italic…) will appear in the chat. Keep in mind that you can easily combine the formatting styles by using multiple commands at the same time.

Here is an overview of the most important options for changing text style in Discord, and you can preview the text style in real time before sending to friends:

![Change Text Style in Discord  - Basic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-change-text-style.jpg)

#### **How to Bold Text in Discord?**

A simple way to use bold text style is to add two asterisks (\*\*) at the beginning and the end of the text that you want to have this effect.

#### **How to Italicize in Discord?**

Italicized style of text will be displayed in the chat if you put one asterisk character (\*) before and one more after the selected text.

#### **How to Write Strikethrough and Make Discord Cross Out Text?**

In order to get a strikethrough effect on your text, you will have to type two tilde characters (\~\~) on either side of the section of text that you want to change, and then you will create an appearance of a crossed-out portion of text.

#### **How to Make Discord Underline Text?**

Underline effect is also available on Discord and equally simple to activate. Just type two underscore dashes (\_\_)at the start and the ending of the text selection to apply it.

### How to Combine Text Formatting Options in Discord?

Once you mastered the basic effects and know the commands without thinking, it’s time to consider more complex text transformations that combine more than one effect. In principle, Markdown lets you do this just as easily, for as long as you know all the right combinations of characters that produce the desired effect. Here are the detailed instructions for some of the most frequently utilized combos:

#### Underlined and Italicized text

For this elegant combination, use two underscore dashes (\_\_) followed by one asterisk (\*) before and after the selected text.

![Discord Underlined and Italicized text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-text.jpg)

#### Underlined and Bolded text

Put two underscore dashes (\_\_) and add two asterisk characters (\*\*) to both sides of the selection to get those two effects together.

![Discord Underlined and Bolded text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-bolded-text.jpg)

#### Underlined, Italicized, and Bolded text

This combination is achieved by placing two underscore marks (\_\_) and three straight asterisks (\*\*\*) at the beginning as well as the end of the text.

![Discord Underlined &  Italicized Bolded  text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-bolded-text.jpg)

#### Bolded, Italicized, underlined, and crossed out text

You can combine all four style changes as well – just use two tildes (\~\~), two underscores (\_\_) and three asterisks (\*\*\*) on either side of your text.

![Discord Underlined &  Italicized Bolded crossed out text ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-bolded-cross-out-text.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Use Code Block for Discord Text Formatting?

In addition to simple font transformations, Discord allows users to engage in advanced text formatting with incredible ease. One way to do it is to deploy code blocks, which can be activated with the backtick character ( \` ) placed on the beginning and the end of a text section. This command will highlight the chosen part of the text while preserving blank space around it for extra emphasis of your message. However, if you use three consecutive ( \` ) signs before a block of text and separate the text into several lines by pressing enter, the result will be a series of highlighted lines that form a single code block. This option is simple enough that even beginners with no programming abilities can easily learn how to use it, and it has some practical applications that savvy Discord users are very fond of.

## Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?

It’s not possible to alter the default text color from the native user interface in Discord. However, there is a simple solution to this problem that involves the highlight.is scrip mentioned earlier in the article. This Javascript-based library can transform the normal text into a code block consisting of three lines, where the middle line would be your selection of text in an alternative color. This is a neat workaround that’s very simple to activate using the same kind of text-based commands described above.

To change the text color, you should create a simple, three-line block. In the top line, you need to put three backtick characters (”’) along with a code phrase corresponding to the text color you would like to use. In the second line, you should type your entire text normally, while the bottom line should include three more backticks. You can create new lines by pressing the Shift and Enter keys at the same time.

Here is a detailed video tutorial for creating customized text in a range of different colors with all the relevant code phrases.

## FAQs About Discord Text Formatting

#### 1\. What is the default Discord font?

Discord uses the same basic font all over the entire platform, including all chats between users and in your profile info. This is Uni sans font, which is quite simple and belongs to the sans serif family of fonts that are known for good readability on almost any background.

#### 2\. How do you get different fonts on Discord?

It’s not possible to change the font directly from the Discord app, but this limitation can be circumvented if you find a good[Discord font generator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on the internet. Those are very easy to use, so you can simply type your text in a chosen font and copy it back into Discord already formatted.

#### 3\. How to make a hidden text in Discord?

The creation of a hidden text message that requires direct user action to reveal is possible in Discord and requires a so-called spoiler tag. If you precede your message with the text /spoiler or type two slash bars ( //) at either side, it will be hidden from other users except for those who decide to view it and indicate their desire by clicking or tapping on it. Messages of this kind appear highlighted with gray background in the message stream on a Discord chat.

## Part 2: How to Change Text Style in Discord with Markdown?

As we mentioned previously, Markdown is completely text-based and has a very simple syntax. All you need to do to apply special formatting to your text is to enter a few special characters at the right places, and the appropriate effect (bold, italic…) will appear in the chat. Keep in mind that you can easily combine the formatting styles by using multiple commands at the same time.

Here is an overview of the most important options for changing text style in Discord, and you can preview the text style in real time before sending to friends:

![Change Text Style in Discord  - Basic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-change-text-style.jpg)

#### **How to Bold Text in Discord?**

A simple way to use bold text style is to add two asterisks (\*\*) at the beginning and the end of the text that you want to have this effect.

#### **How to Italicize in Discord?**

Italicized style of text will be displayed in the chat if you put one asterisk character (\*) before and one more after the selected text.

#### **How to Write Strikethrough and Make Discord Cross Out Text?**

In order to get a strikethrough effect on your text, you will have to type two tilde characters (\~\~) on either side of the section of text that you want to change, and then you will create an appearance of a crossed-out portion of text.

#### **How to Make Discord Underline Text?**

Underline effect is also available on Discord and equally simple to activate. Just type two underscore dashes (\_\_)at the start and the ending of the text selection to apply it.

### How to Combine Text Formatting Options in Discord?

Once you mastered the basic effects and know the commands without thinking, it’s time to consider more complex text transformations that combine more than one effect. In principle, Markdown lets you do this just as easily, for as long as you know all the right combinations of characters that produce the desired effect. Here are the detailed instructions for some of the most frequently utilized combos:

#### Underlined and Italicized text

For this elegant combination, use two underscore dashes (\_\_) followed by one asterisk (\*) before and after the selected text.

![Discord Underlined and Italicized text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-text.jpg)

#### Underlined and Bolded text

Put two underscore dashes (\_\_) and add two asterisk characters (\*\*) to both sides of the selection to get those two effects together.

![Discord Underlined and Bolded text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-bolded-text.jpg)

#### Underlined, Italicized, and Bolded text

This combination is achieved by placing two underscore marks (\_\_) and three straight asterisks (\*\*\*) at the beginning as well as the end of the text.

![Discord Underlined &  Italicized Bolded  text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-bolded-text.jpg)

#### Bolded, Italicized, underlined, and crossed out text

You can combine all four style changes as well – just use two tildes (\~\~), two underscores (\_\_) and three asterisks (\*\*\*) on either side of your text.

![Discord Underlined &  Italicized Bolded crossed out text ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-bolded-cross-out-text.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Use Code Block for Discord Text Formatting?

In addition to simple font transformations, Discord allows users to engage in advanced text formatting with incredible ease. One way to do it is to deploy code blocks, which can be activated with the backtick character ( \` ) placed on the beginning and the end of a text section. This command will highlight the chosen part of the text while preserving blank space around it for extra emphasis of your message. However, if you use three consecutive ( \` ) signs before a block of text and separate the text into several lines by pressing enter, the result will be a series of highlighted lines that form a single code block. This option is simple enough that even beginners with no programming abilities can easily learn how to use it, and it has some practical applications that savvy Discord users are very fond of.

## Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?

It’s not possible to alter the default text color from the native user interface in Discord. However, there is a simple solution to this problem that involves the highlight.is scrip mentioned earlier in the article. This Javascript-based library can transform the normal text into a code block consisting of three lines, where the middle line would be your selection of text in an alternative color. This is a neat workaround that’s very simple to activate using the same kind of text-based commands described above.

To change the text color, you should create a simple, three-line block. In the top line, you need to put three backtick characters (”’) along with a code phrase corresponding to the text color you would like to use. In the second line, you should type your entire text normally, while the bottom line should include three more backticks. You can create new lines by pressing the Shift and Enter keys at the same time.

Here is a detailed video tutorial for creating customized text in a range of different colors with all the relevant code phrases.

## FAQs About Discord Text Formatting

#### 1\. What is the default Discord font?

Discord uses the same basic font all over the entire platform, including all chats between users and in your profile info. This is Uni sans font, which is quite simple and belongs to the sans serif family of fonts that are known for good readability on almost any background.

#### 2\. How do you get different fonts on Discord?

It’s not possible to change the font directly from the Discord app, but this limitation can be circumvented if you find a good[Discord font generator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on the internet. Those are very easy to use, so you can simply type your text in a chosen font and copy it back into Discord already formatted.

#### 3\. How to make a hidden text in Discord?

The creation of a hidden text message that requires direct user action to reveal is possible in Discord and requires a so-called spoiler tag. If you precede your message with the text /spoiler or type two slash bars ( //) at either side, it will be hidden from other users except for those who decide to view it and indicate their desire by clicking or tapping on it. Messages of this kind appear highlighted with gray background in the message stream on a Discord chat.

Discord is packed with great features, but one thing it’s missing is a screen recorder. You can chat, enjoy video calls and share your screen with friends or colleagues, but you can’t record these conversations or videos without using a third-party app.

Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.

One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.

* [Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord](#part2)
* [Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android](#part3)
* [Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?](#part4)

## Part 1: Best Windows/Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord

If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust [screen recording tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.

### 1. OBS

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.

There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.

### 2. Bandicam

Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.

Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn't involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95\. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.

### 3. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features [screen recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 4. DemoCreator

If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider [Wondershare DemoCreator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/). Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.

You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.

### 5. Camtasia

If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.

However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.

## Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord

If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.

### 2. Screen Capture

One such option is [Screen Capture](https://www.screencapture.com/), which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.

There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

### 3. Clipchamp

If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/). Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.

It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.

### 3. Screencast-o-matic

The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is [Screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder). This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.

The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.

## Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android

If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.

### 1. AZ Screen Recorder

[AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US) is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.

It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.

### 2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots

Another option for Android is [‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US). Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.

The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.

### 3. Record It

If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘[Record It!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545)’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.

The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.

## Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?

If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.

Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.

You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.

If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.

Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.

The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.

Thankfully, there are plenty of choices for finding the best screen recorder for Discord. So here we’ll take you through the best options for Discord on the browser, on Windows and Mac, and on mobile so that no matter how you use Discord, you can record those epic gaming sessions or study groups for you to revisit later.

One thing to note before we begin – make sure everyone in your chat or server knows they’re being recorded. In some countries, it’s illegal to record someone without their permission, but even where legalities don’t matter, you don’t want to upset people by recording them without them being aware.

## Part 1: Best Windows/Mac Screen Recorder Software for Discord

If you prefer to use the Discord app on Windows or Mac, you’ll want a more robust [screen recording tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Here are four of the best screen recorders for Discord app users.

### 1. OBS

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source tool that many people use to stream live and record their screens. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and offers customization tools.

There are no pricing plans, everything is completely free, and it lets you add a range of sources so that you can record your webcam, Discord audio, and everything on the screen, including any overlays. The two main drawbacks to OBS are its complexity – it can be demanding on your computer, and it’s not the easiest to use. So expect to take some time getting a handle on how to set it up first.

### 2. Bandicam

Bandicam is another option that manages to be more intuitive. It’s easy to use, although it has many options to help you get the perfect recording. But if you’re not interested in spending ages tinkering, Bandicam is more likely to give you a higher quality recording using default settings, and it’s less demanding.

Bandicam isn’t free, but it doesn't involve a monthly subscription, unlike many suggested tools. A one-off license for Bandicam for one PC is $39.95, or you can get a two-PC license for $59.95\. If you want the editing software, Bandicut included, then that’s $60.95 with a single license. It’s also worth noting that Bandicam only works on Windows.

### 3. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though Filmora is a specialized video editing software, it also features [screen recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam recording, and audio recording tools. One of the biggest advantages of using Filmora to record Discord videos is that it features lots of elements and game video special effects, which will make your video cool. You can head to Part 4 of this article for detailed information about recording Discord video.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 4. DemoCreator

If you plan to edit your screen recordings before uploading them, consider [Wondershare DemoCreator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/). Working with both Windows and Mac, it’s a powerful screen recorder with some basic editing features, making it easy to turn your screen records into epic videos.

You can record in up to 120fps using two devices, such as your screen and webcam, and as well as the editing suite, there are effects tools you can utilize as well. Choose an annual subscription for $23.99 or buy a perpetual license for one PC for $47.99.

### 5. Camtasia

If you’re specifically looking to record your Discord screen to record tutorials, then [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is a specialist tool with various templates that you can use to record professional-quality videos using your Discord app.

However, while Camtasia is fantastic for these videos, it lacks some of the effects options you might want if you’re recording game streams. And the cost is a huge factor, too – it’s around $300 for a one-off license, with an annual fee of $60 if you need ongoing support and an extra $25 for some of the additional capture tools required.

## Part 2: Best Online Screen Recorder for Discord

If you’re using the online version of Discord in your web browser, you’ll be best suited to a screen recorded that specialist recorder.

### 2. Screen Capture

One such option is [Screen Capture](https://www.screencapture.com/), which is extremely easy to use. As well as recording what’s happening on the screen, you have the option to record your microphone, audio, and webcam. As soon as your head to the Screen Capture website, you can start recording in one click, although the free version does have a watermark. It’s £4.95 per month to remove this.

There’s no software to download, and your videos will be saved in HD quality. You’ll need to click Start Recording and then, in the pop-up, permit it to record your screen. It works with all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

### 3. Clipchamp

If you need some more tools at your disposal, you might prefer [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/screen-recorder/). Unlike Screen Capture, you’ll need to create an account, and the free version only lets you output in standard definition. However, Clipchamp includes editing tools to record and tweak your footage before exporting it easily.

It works fully with Chrome and Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, with partial support for other browsers. If you want to output at 720p or higher, you’ll need to upgrade to a Creator account at $9 per month, while Full HD is available with a Business account for $19 per month.

### 3. Screencast-o-matic

The third option we would recommend as one of the best screen recorders for online Discord is [Screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder). This will record whatever is on the screen in any browser, working on all Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS systems.

The free option lets you record up to 15 minutes of footage, while the Deluxe removes that limit and includes basic editing for $1.65 per month. However, the difference here is that you’ll need to download an application to record your browser – it’s not just an online tool. Once it’s downloaded, just run the software, and you can record Discord in your browser with a few clicks.

## Part 3: Best Screen Recorder Apps for Discord on iPhone and Android

If you prefer to use the Discord mobile app, you’ll need a dedicated smartphone tool to record your screen. It’s important to do your research, as mobile apps are often full of ads or issues that can cause your device to slow down to a crawl. It’s not helped because review scores are so easily manipulated. You should use one of these recommendations for what we feel are the best screen recorders for Discord mobile.

### 1. AZ Screen Recorder

[AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US) is a free tool you can download from the Google Play Store on an Android device. It lets you record in Full HD quality at 60fps, ideal for recording your Discord video calls to share or review later.

It also includes some editing tools, so you can trim your video, add text or music, and compress it to reduce the file size. However, a major drawback is that it cannot record audio from the source – instead, it’ll record through your phone’s microphone. This is great if you want to add commentary, but not so much if you’re dealing with background noise.

### 2. Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots

Another option for Android is [‘Screen Recorder for Game, Video Call, Screenshots’](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screen.recorder&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US). Despite the mouthful of a name, it’s a pretty simple app to use, and again it’s free. It has an advantage over AZ Screen Recorder in that it can record up to 1440p, perfect for then sharing over Discord with users on a gaming monitor.

The main issue with Screen Recorder is that it’s a little unreliable at times, with many people struggling to access the extra video editing tools. But if you were to combine Screen Recorder with editing software like Filmora, you could get a comprehensive solution for Discord mobile recording.

### 3. Record It

If you’re an iOS user, you’ll want to look at ‘[Record It!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/record-it-screen-recorder/id1245356545)’. It’s another free option that works well on both iPhone and iPad, letting you record your apps, including Discord. You can record the entire screen in high quality and add your Face Cam as an overlay.

The included editor doesn’t have amazingly comprehensive tools, but you can trim your video, add a filter or adjust the playback speed. But, again, if you want to do more intensive editing, you’ll need to pair it with dedicated software such as Filmora.

## Part 4: How to Record Discord Video Screen with Filmora?

If you want to record your screen with Filmora, create a video tutorial, or show off your gaming skills.

Start by heading to File and then Record Media, and choose the option to Record from PC.

You’ll then get a pop-up that lets you choose how much of your screen you want to capture. Enter a custom resolution, or drag the box that’s appeared on your screen to the size and location you want to record. You can also use this screen to configure whether your microphone and system audio is recorded.

If you click on the Settings cog, you’ll get a dropdown with more options – change the resolution, frame rate, and the location where you’re saving the file. You can also change the settings for showing mouse clicks, which you’ll want to do if you’re making a tutorial.

Once you hit the red record button, the screen will start recording after a countdown of five seconds – ample time to switch browser window to Discord. Then, when you’re done, head back to Filmora and click the Stop button at the top-right of the screen.

The video will save automatically to your chosen file path. You can then drag it into Filmora to trim off the start and end, if necessary, and use all of Filmora’s editing tools to enhance your video.
