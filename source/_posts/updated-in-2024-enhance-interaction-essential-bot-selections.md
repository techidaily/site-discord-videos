On Discord, users can communicate by directly messaging another user or creating a group chat. But the most common and best way is to create servers where everyone gets together and has fun.

To manage these servers and the members, and to provide more facilities, there are a lot of bots that provide a variety of features from user management to entertainment and music and more. A bot is basically a programmed Discord account that can be added to multiple servers and then provides certain functions to the members in that server using commands.
