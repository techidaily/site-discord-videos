Discord is the creation of gamers, but it shouldn’t scare you off. This free video and text chat service is now a prominent platform for anyone looking to start public or private communities.

Discord lets friends communicate directly via video, voice, or text and join servers where larger communities can hang up.

However, any online community can access the features Discord provides.

In this guide, we're going to dive into how to create your aesthetic **Discord PFP** beginning with the requirements, top Discord PFPs 2021, and a tool to create your own PFP for Discord.

* [Part 1: An Introduction to PFP for Discord](#part1)
* [Part 2: Best 5 Discord PFP](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Design a Discord PFP Avatar in Filmora?](#part3)
* [Part 4: Best 3 Websites to Grow Your Discord Server PFP](#part4)

## **Part 1: An Introduction to PFP for Discord**

Every element on any social platform contributes to the overall user’s impression. His profile picture or Discord PFP is one of the most effective elements that go a long way towards branding.

**Note**: Discord users can only use a single avatar or profile picture on the platform and can't switch between servers.

Keeping this in mind, selecting a cool PFP for Discord helps you represent yourself everywhere on the Discord platform.

#### Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance

Like all other online communication platforms, Discord has rules regarding the suitability of specific images and the use of an avatar.

Firstly, you must know the size limit of images which shouldn’t be too large as it can affect the channel. On the other hand, too small images may look bad and are not legible due to pixelization.

The ideal images size for your Discord PFP is at least 512 x 512 pixels – enough to be visible and far above the 180 x 180-pixel minimum.

Discord allows photographs and various types of cartoon images, memes, and illustrations and accepts JPG and the Discord GIF PFP.

Also, there are community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your Discord PFP submission might get rejected for failing to meet Discord’s terms and conditions.

No NSFW images are allowed on Discord. Explicit nudity or pornographic content is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality or showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions.

## **Part 2: Best 5 Discord PFP**

Discord is overrun with anime/videogame and other cool PFP for Discord. If you’re unfamiliar with either of these, selecting a PFP for Discord can be a challenge.

So today, we have devised a selection of the 5 best of what we believe are the best Discord profile pictures.

#### 1. My Hero Academia – Midoriya Izuku

![my hero academia discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/my-hero-academia-discord.jpg)

This is a lowkey one. This picture of a young Midoriya Izuku gives a very tired and sleepy vibe. The poor child doesn’t know what the future holds for him.

#### 2. Re:Zero – Rem-Rin

![rem rin discord pfp](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-pfp-rem-rin.jpg)

Rem, the anime character stole everyone's heart who watched the show in 2016\. With Season 2 over the head, this is the perfect opportunity to show that you're on team Rem.

#### 3. Kermit The Frog – Everyone Loves Kermit

![kermit frog discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/kermit-frog-discord.jpg)

We all love Kermit, the frog. Use his smiling picture to make everyone's day just a tad bit better.

#### 4. Shrek – Meme Face

![shrek discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shrek-discord.jpg)

If cuteness isn't up your alley, here's a funny profile picture. Poor Shrek, what have they done to your beautiful face.

#### 5. Persona 5 – Joker

![discord pfp persona 5 joker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-pfp-persona-joker.jpg)

If you're a Persona franchise fan of the Persona franchise, I offer this profile picture to you. The joker, looking as stunning as always.

## **Part 3: How to Design a Discord PFP Avatar in Filmora?**

If you are also among the users who decide to create custom anime Discord PFPor other PFP for Discord, this option is highly advisable to unveil your creative skills.

It is an effort to make a fantastic Discord PFPor avatar that will be unique and exactly narrates your story behind the brand. You can use many different software tools for this purpose, but since the task is effortless, you can use an accessible and practical program such as Filmora.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The process of designing a PFP for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complicated and consists of just a few simple steps.

Begin by selecting or choosing the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be a real-life photo or an animated avatar. You can download from some discord PFP sites or directly search on Google.

Next, upload the chosen image into a new project and then resize it to fit preferred Discord dimensions. To modify the shape, click **Effects** \-> **Utility** \-> **Image Mask** to optimize **PFP for Discord**.

![create discord avatar Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-overlay-image-mask-discord-profile-wondershare-filmora.jpg)

By adding overlays to the primary image, you can further enhance its visual or textual elements to customize the Discord PFPavatar.

And, you can also consider using Discord GIF PFPsto get maximum attention. A GIF avatar that jumps off the page in every chat you are a part of highlights a strong vibe of creativity.

## **Part 4: Best 3 Websites to Grow Your Discord Server PFP**

There are different ways to carry our Discord server growth, and one of them is to submit your Discord server to server directories or websites that allow you to post a listing for your server.

### 1\. [Disboard](https://disboard.org/servers)

![discord server pfp disboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-server-pfp-disboard.jpg)

Disboard is one of the demanding server listing sites out there, and

As severs here are browsed by category, ensure that you select the correct category while adding it to your listing.

No matter you have a music server or a gaming server, there's sure to be a category for your server, and if not, there's also an "other" server category, so fear not!

### 2.[Top.gg](https://top.gg/servers)

![top gg discord server](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-gg-discord-server.jpg)

Top.gg, which is a bot, is another best server listing site. It helps you submit listings for both your servers and bots with a fantastic user interface.

The listings display the number of emotes available, the voting mechanism, as well as your server's description.

Servers categorize through tags, including Anime, Music, and 30 plus other categories to explore better.

A cool feature of the site is the users' comments on the custom server listing pages so that you can enjoy a great community.

### 3\. [Discord Servers.com](https://discordservers.com/server/536415342411644929)

![discord servers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/discord-servers-pfp.jpg)

If you're hoping to grow Discord server and its associated Discord PFP, Discord Servers is another preferred server listing website.

It allows users to submit your listing on category pages, including Minecraft, Programming, Anime, and other categories. And, there are high chances that you will find your category on this server as it's quite vast.

However, adding your Discord server to this listing will require a bot to be added to your server.

### Conclusion

So, this was the gist of creating fantastic Discord PFPs in 2021! With the top-performing examples of PFPs for Discord, you can take a hint and follow your own rules of creativity with Wondershare Filmora – your only Discord PFP avatar maker!

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Since the pandemic, communication-based social media websites have become even more popular; be it Instagram, Twitter, or Discord; they have amassed millions of users.

Some of these users are credible organizations, companies, celebrities, or other revered personalities. And they are usually given verified accounts. The mark of a verified account is the tiny blue tick next to the name.

People strive for this blue tick because it makes their account seem “official”; other users don’t mind sharing from and sharing with these accounts.

Once users know that a specific social media account is a verified one, they would never hesitate to interact with them.

If you want that kind of reverence for your online presence, keep reading as we elaborate on **how to get verified on Discord**:

#### In this article

* [Part 1: How to Get Verified On Discord](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Apply For Discord Partnership](#part2)
* [Part 3: Differences Between Discord Verification And Partnership](#part3)

## Part 1: How to Get Verified On Discord

Verification on social media sites is most often used as proving your identity when you are a semi-famous or famous individual.

However, unlike the variety of other social media platforms, Discord does not verify just about anyone with a large following.

Presently, verification on Discord is limited to publishers and game developers, Spotify verified musical artists, and professional e-sports teams with massive followers and monthly listeners.

Suppose you are a content creator on YouTube, Twitch, or Reddit. In that case, you can also apply for Discord Partnership, which is an alternative account identification form.

Therefore, read on as we discuss **how to get verified on Discord**:

### Requirements Of Getting Verified On Discord

If you want to get verified on Discord, here are all the things you need to know about the application and qualification process:

* You must be a server owner and be the official representative of a group, team, or individual applying
* The server being verified must also meet the [community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) of Discord
* If you do not fall into any of the categories mentioned above, you cannot be verified on Discord
* However, if you do meet the criteria, you would have to go to [discordapp.com/verification](https://discord.com/verification) and click on “Apply Now”
* Applicants are also required to provide an associated email address, along with the supplementary information proving their identity

Suppose you do not fit into the Discord verification criteria, but you are a streamer or a content creator. In that case, you can apply for your server to become a Discord Partner.

## Part 2: How to Apply For Discord Partnership

Recently there was a change in the Discord Partner Program, rewarding more active servers instead of the server owners with a large following outside of Discord.

For eligibility in the Discord Partner Program, the server in question must meet the Activity Requirements that are listed in the Partner Program portion of Server Insights.

You must keep in mind that partnership is not automatic, and you must fill out an application. Discord can also remove your partnership at any time if the requirements mentioned above are not met for a prolonged period.

### Requirements For Partner Discord Servers

The Discord partner program provides engaged and well-moderated servers with the extra tools and recognition to re-invest in the community. The accepted servers also get additional benefits and perks.

![Get Certified on Discord - Enable Discord Community Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-discord-community-interface.jpg)

Before submitting your Partner application, you would need to check the server engagement requirements.

The servers thinking of applying to the Partner program have to be marked as “Community” servers in the Server Settings, allowing access to Server Insights.

![How to Get Certified on Discord - Discord Partner Program](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-partner-program.jpg)

The Server Insights will help you look at how close you are to applying to the Discord Partner Program.

You can also track the progress towards unlocking your Partner Program application anytime inside the Server Insights and the in-app Partner page.

Once you attain access to this page, there are specific server requirements that you would have to reach:

* The server must be a minimum of eight weeks old
* You must have a minimum of 500 members on your server
* Have a minimum of fifty communicators, people actively talking on your server per week
* Have a minimum of a hundred participators, people visiting/viewing your server per week
* Have a minimum of 20% Week 1 retention over a period of 8 weeks
* You must have enabled the two-factor authentication requirement for Server Moderation. This can be found in the Server Settings and then going to Moderation

Once you are a Discord Partner, you will get access to the VIP features mentioned below:

* You will receive a banner for your server
* You will receive an animated server icon
* The server and the server owner will receive a Discord Partner badge
* The server owner will receive a subscription to Discord Nitro throughout the partnership
* The partnered server also receives a customizable vanity invite URL

## Part 3: Differences Between Discord Verification And Partnership

**Discord verification** goes to servers that are run by brands, figures of public interest, and businesses. A verified badge shows the official home of that community.

Acceptance into the **Discord Verification** program only gives you server access to the Vanity URL, Verified Server badge, and the invite splash background.

In contrast, the Partner program provides a server banner, animated server icon, Nitro subscription, and a Discord Partner badge.

Furthermore, the Discord Partner Program aims to reward engaged, quality servers by providing them with extra tools and recognition, helping them invest further into their community.

A partner badge next to a server’s name indicates that it is one of the most engaging and reliable communities on Discord.

You might be thinking, can I be Discord Verified and Discord Partner at the same time? The answer is yes, you can.

If you are qualified for both programs, you can be in them. A Discord Verified server could send its application to the Discord Partner Program when they satisfy Partner Program requirements.

Lastly, if a server is removed from one of the programs, it can still be in the other one. Like, suppose a server is both Verified and Partnered but loses its Partnership. In that case, it can still stay verified and enjoy all the added benefits of **Discord Verification**.

## Frequently Asked Question about Getting Verification on Discord

#### Question 1: How long will it take to complete verification on Discord?

Answer: Generally, it would take around 5 business day to complete the verfication. However, the time may varies depend on the amount of application.

_Soure: Discord Support_

#### Question 2: Will I get charged for getting my server verified?

Answer: No. You won't be charged for getting your Discord server verified.

#### Question: Can I apply verification if our server is run by fan?

Answer: No, fan server can not be verified.
