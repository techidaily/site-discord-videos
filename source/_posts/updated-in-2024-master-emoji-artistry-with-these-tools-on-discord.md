The good thing about Discord is that it's for everyone, regardless of the platform, device, or OS they may be using.

This includes changing or adjusting the avatar features such as eyebrows and hairstyle to face type and clothing.

ZMoji keyboard, an extension of the ZMoji application, is a must if you love animated emojis. It offers an extensive range of stickers, and you won't run out of options anytime soon.
