Discord’s a great tool for getting together with people who share your interests and sharing content, ideas and discussions. The only thing is, most people have quite a few interests, and so your server is likely to be fighting for attention amongst many other servers. Users can join up to 100, after all. So, a good **Discord server logo** is essential, as it makes it easier for your server to stand out and be found. This article will look at the best free Discord server logo makers.

* [Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker](#part1)
* [Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites](#part2)
* [Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel Tips](#part3)
* [Part 4: FAQs about Discord Logo and Icon](#part4)

## Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker

We’ve picked out some of the best free logo makers, so you can customize your own Discord server logo.

### 1  Logo.Bot

[Logo.Bot](https://www.logo.bot/) uses AI to generate your logo for you, so that you don’t need to worry about drawing anything. It can create a professional logo that you can easily download to use for your Discord server.

Firstly, it’ll ask for your ‘Company’ information – just use the name and description of your Discord server.

![Discord Logo Maker - Logo Bot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fill-in-company-info-logo-bot.jpg)

You’ll then be asked to choose a colour scheme, so pick one that is either relevant to your server or that you simply like. You can pick up at most 3 colors.

![Discord Logo Maker - Logo Bot - select color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-color-logo-bot.jpg)

Next, it’ll give you a list of icons to choose from based on your details already entered, but you can still search for new keywords if you want. Choose up to five icons.

![ Logo Bot icon Preference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-icon-preference.jpg)

Logo Bot will then generate 3 logos based on the information provided before. You can then edit your favourite options using the site’s built-in tools.

![ Logo Bot preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-preview.jpg)

Once you’re done, you can download a free version of your logo as a low-resolution JPG. The problem is that it’ll come with a watermark. If you want the version that is best suited to Discord without a watermark, you’ll need to pay a one-off fee of $20.

![ Logo Bot editing interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-editing-interface.jpg)

### 2  MyBrandNewLogo

[MyBrandNewLogo](https://mybrandnewlogo.com/) is another option that makes it simple to create Discord logos. They even have a specialist tool just for Discord. You’ll start by giving the name of your server (‘Company’) again.

![ MyBrandNewLogo interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-start-interface.jpg)

Then, you can enter some keywords to help it choose the icons to use as part of your logo.

With MyBrandNewLogo, the colour options are slightly more limited than with Logo.Bot, but you can also ask it to surprise you if you aren’t too fussed about the colour to use.

![ MyBrandNewLogo select color ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-select-color.jpg)

From there, you’ll again be shown a mix of icons and fonts combined to create a logo. You can then edit the layout of your logo, the background, add a slogan, change the icon and more to tailor it to your exact specifications.

![ MyBrandNewLogo editing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-editing-interface.jpg)

Unfortunately again you do need to sign up and pay to download your logo. A basic package with one low-res file is €20, while the Professional pack costs €50.

![ MyBrandNewLogo purchase interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-perchase-interface.jpg)

### 3  Logo.com

The third option is <https://logo.com/>. Here you dive straight in – as soon as you’ve entered your Discord server name. You will see a list of logos that you can use as a base design. So it automatically reads your server name and searches for icons related to the term. For the generated logo files, click the Custmoize button to adjust.

![ Logo.com interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-generated-logos.jpg)

You can then work your way down the list on the left, editing the icons to decide where you want it to live, and how big it should be. You can adjust its design, the icons on the logo, the color and the colour themes of your logo, the text, including the font and any changes to how it’s displayed.

![ Logo.com editing interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-editing-interface.jpg)

Once done, you can then preview your final logo. And yet again, you need to pay to download the full version. It’s $19.99 for a high-res PNG and JPG, but if you want a scalable Vector you need to pay $59.99 for the Starter Kit.

### 4  BrandCrowd

[BrandCrowd](https://www.brandcrowd.com/) is another logo creation site you could use, where again you simply enter your Discord server name and it’ll instantly generate icons for you to customize. Unlike Logo.com it doesn’t have a simple step-by-step editor, but instead it’s a lot more powerful, with various tools you can use to adjust shadows, layers and more.

![ BrandCrowd logo maker interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-interface.jpg)

Once you’ve played with the editor, you can click Preview to see how it’ll look on a dummy website (or even on merch), then Download to sign up and access the files…but again they are hidden behind a paywall. BrandCrowd is one of the more expensive options too – a one off fee is $45 to get the high res PNG and JPG as well as vector files, or you can subscribe for $15 per month to unlock unlimited edits and downloads. The previews are watermarked to prevent you from just taking them.

![ BrandCrowd logo maker editing interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-editing-interface.jpg)

### 5  Kapwing

The final recommendation is [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/explore/discord-server-icon-maker-512x512-pixels). Kapwing is, by far, the most comprehensive tool we’ve suggested so far. It isn’t just for creating logos, but working on all kinds of exportable content. The link we’ve included will take you straight to a dedicated workspace for Discord logos, but you’ll then need to upload all of your own imagery (although you can search Kapwing’s own resource collection) and make changes. It requires more skill, but the end results are more professional.

Using the menu at the top, you can play with text, add extra elements, or use the image tool to upload your own files or search Kapwing’s database.

![ Kapwing logo maker editing interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-logo-editing-interface.jpg)

Once you’ve edited your logo, it’s already pre-set to download at 512 x 512\. You’ll just need to create an account to access your download without a watermark, but it is free. The only drawback is that files are only available as JPG or GIF – so you can’t use a PNG with a transparent background.

Unfortunately, most of the ‘free’ online tools for creating Discord server logos aren’t actually free, or they come with limitations. There are other options than using online tools to create a logo however.

## Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites

Rather than creating your own logo, you might want a helping hand – these download sites let you choose an existing icon, and edit it to your own tastes.

### 1  Icons8

[Icons8](https://icons8.com/) is by far the best option of all the free icon download sites. It’s really easy to use, with clear categorization to make finding the perfect logo easier. You can download each icon in PNG or SVG format (or even PDF, if you wanted to for some reason) and customize the size. You can embed the HTML directly and, if you download the Lunacy editor, make tweaks to it before you download it. It’s super simple, and the only minor drawback is you’ll need to register an account, but it’s free.

![ Icons8 Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons8-discord-icons-download.jpg)

### 2  Iconfinder

[Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) is also relatively easy to navigate, and it also lets you download a PNG or SVG version of the file in a size that you prefer. You can’t edit, nor can you embed the HTML, and many of the icons are behind a paywall. However when you do find a free one, you can download it without a subscription.

![ Iconfinder  Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iconfinder-discord-icon.jpg)

### 3  BrandEPS

[BrandEPS](https://www.brandeps.com/) is another popular name for icon downloading but it specializes in existing brand logos. If you want something distinct and unique, you won’t find it here. But if your Discord server is about an existing brand, you can probably download its logo here in either a vector EPS or as part of a zip file with SVG, PNG and JPG versions. No need to sign up.

![ BrandEPS Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/brandeps-discord-logo-vector.jpg)

### 4  FreePNGLogos

[FreePNGLogos](https://www.freepnglogos.com/) is another database of existing company icons and logos, and as you can probably guess from the name, they’re available to download as PNG files. The sizes are limited to the size it’s been uploaded as, and there’s no easy way to browse, you’ll need to search using key terms and hope you find something suitable.

![ FreePNGLogos Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/freepnglogos-discord-logo-png.jpg)

### 5  SeekLogo

Finally, [SeekLogo](https://seeklogo.com/) has a large database of corporate logos but they’re not optimized icons, they’re full size logos including full business names. Downloads are mainly in SVG format, and again the option to browse is minimal, you’ll be relying on search terms and the categorization of icons isn’t the most intuitive.

![ SeekLogo Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seeklogo-discord.jpg)

## Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel - Tips

When you’re naming your server, a longer name might be harder to remember. If you can create a name that you can then abbreviate, you can include the abbreviation in your logo design, so it’s even easier to find your server. Even better, if it can be an acronym (an abbreviation that also forms its own short word) then it’ll be even more memorable.

The other key tip when creating your Discord server logo is to embrace your creativity! Don’t be scared to really make your logo stand out, especially when it’s around a topic that other Discord servers may exist for. You need to make it easy for your server logo to be understood and remembered, and a bold logo is ideal.

## FAQs

#### 1\. What is a Discord Logo?

A **Discord logo** is an icon that’s associated with your Discord server. For any Discord user, the servers they’re a member of are listed by logo, so making a distinctive one that is clearly associated with your server is important for helping people to easily find the server they’re looking for.

#### 2\. What is the Best Size for Discord Channel Logos?

The size of your Discord logo is important, because if it’s too small then it means the logo will be poor quality, while if it’s too large then finer details just won’t be visible – the logo is only ever shown as a small icon. Aim for 512 x 512 pixels.

#### 3\. What is the Best Discord Logo Shape?

Discord logos are displayed as circles, so the easiest way to make sure your logo is properly displayed is to create it as a circle. If you upload a logo in a different shape, you risk having part of your logo cut off, or it being centered incorrectly.

#### 4\. How to Change the Server Logo on Discord?

When you first create your Discord server, you’ll be shown a ‘Getting started’ list where one of the actions is to personalize the server with an icon.

If you’ve already established your Discord server and no longer see this option, then you can simply right-click on your server to find a menu option for the server settings, where you’ll also find the option to update your server logo.

![ MyBrandNewLogo editing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-editing-interface.jpg)

Unfortunately again you do need to sign up and pay to download your logo. A basic package with one low-res file is €20, while the Professional pack costs €50.

![ MyBrandNewLogo purchase interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-perchase-interface.jpg)

### 3  Logo.com

The third option is <https://logo.com/>. Here you dive straight in – as soon as you’ve entered your Discord server name. You will see a list of logos that you can use as a base design. So it automatically reads your server name and searches for icons related to the term. For the generated logo files, click the Custmoize button to adjust.

![ Logo.com interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-generated-logos.jpg)

You can then work your way down the list on the left, editing the icons to decide where you want it to live, and how big it should be. You can adjust its design, the icons on the logo, the color and the colour themes of your logo, the text, including the font and any changes to how it’s displayed.

![ Logo.com editing interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-editing-interface.jpg)

Once done, you can then preview your final logo. And yet again, you need to pay to download the full version. It’s $19.99 for a high-res PNG and JPG, but if you want a scalable Vector you need to pay $59.99 for the Starter Kit.

### 4  BrandCrowd

[BrandCrowd](https://www.brandcrowd.com/) is another logo creation site you could use, where again you simply enter your Discord server name and it’ll instantly generate icons for you to customize. Unlike Logo.com it doesn’t have a simple step-by-step editor, but instead it’s a lot more powerful, with various tools you can use to adjust shadows, layers and more.

![ BrandCrowd logo maker interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-interface.jpg)

Once you’ve played with the editor, you can click Preview to see how it’ll look on a dummy website (or even on merch), then Download to sign up and access the files…but again they are hidden behind a paywall. BrandCrowd is one of the more expensive options too – a one off fee is $45 to get the high res PNG and JPG as well as vector files, or you can subscribe for $15 per month to unlock unlimited edits and downloads. The previews are watermarked to prevent you from just taking them.

![ BrandCrowd logo maker editing interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-editing-interface.jpg)

### 5  Kapwing

The final recommendation is [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/explore/discord-server-icon-maker-512x512-pixels). Kapwing is, by far, the most comprehensive tool we’ve suggested so far. It isn’t just for creating logos, but working on all kinds of exportable content. The link we’ve included will take you straight to a dedicated workspace for Discord logos, but you’ll then need to upload all of your own imagery (although you can search Kapwing’s own resource collection) and make changes. It requires more skill, but the end results are more professional.

Using the menu at the top, you can play with text, add extra elements, or use the image tool to upload your own files or search Kapwing’s database.

![ Kapwing logo maker editing interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-logo-editing-interface.jpg)

Once you’ve edited your logo, it’s already pre-set to download at 512 x 512\. You’ll just need to create an account to access your download without a watermark, but it is free. The only drawback is that files are only available as JPG or GIF – so you can’t use a PNG with a transparent background.

Unfortunately, most of the ‘free’ online tools for creating Discord server logos aren’t actually free, or they come with limitations. There are other options than using online tools to create a logo however.

## Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites

Rather than creating your own logo, you might want a helping hand – these download sites let you choose an existing icon, and edit it to your own tastes.

### 1  Icons8

[Icons8](https://icons8.com/) is by far the best option of all the free icon download sites. It’s really easy to use, with clear categorization to make finding the perfect logo easier. You can download each icon in PNG or SVG format (or even PDF, if you wanted to for some reason) and customize the size. You can embed the HTML directly and, if you download the Lunacy editor, make tweaks to it before you download it. It’s super simple, and the only minor drawback is you’ll need to register an account, but it’s free.

![ Icons8 Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons8-discord-icons-download.jpg)

### 2  Iconfinder

[Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) is also relatively easy to navigate, and it also lets you download a PNG or SVG version of the file in a size that you prefer. You can’t edit, nor can you embed the HTML, and many of the icons are behind a paywall. However when you do find a free one, you can download it without a subscription.

![ Iconfinder  Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iconfinder-discord-icon.jpg)

### 3  BrandEPS

[BrandEPS](https://www.brandeps.com/) is another popular name for icon downloading but it specializes in existing brand logos. If you want something distinct and unique, you won’t find it here. But if your Discord server is about an existing brand, you can probably download its logo here in either a vector EPS or as part of a zip file with SVG, PNG and JPG versions. No need to sign up.

![ BrandEPS Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/brandeps-discord-logo-vector.jpg)

### 4  FreePNGLogos

[FreePNGLogos](https://www.freepnglogos.com/) is another database of existing company icons and logos, and as you can probably guess from the name, they’re available to download as PNG files. The sizes are limited to the size it’s been uploaded as, and there’s no easy way to browse, you’ll need to search using key terms and hope you find something suitable.

![ FreePNGLogos Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/freepnglogos-discord-logo-png.jpg)

### 5  SeekLogo

Finally, [SeekLogo](https://seeklogo.com/) has a large database of corporate logos but they’re not optimized icons, they’re full size logos including full business names. Downloads are mainly in SVG format, and again the option to browse is minimal, you’ll be relying on search terms and the categorization of icons isn’t the most intuitive.

![ SeekLogo Discord logo Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seeklogo-discord.jpg)

## Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel - Tips

When you’re naming your server, a longer name might be harder to remember. If you can create a name that you can then abbreviate, you can include the abbreviation in your logo design, so it’s even easier to find your server. Even better, if it can be an acronym (an abbreviation that also forms its own short word) then it’ll be even more memorable.

The other key tip when creating your Discord server logo is to embrace your creativity! Don’t be scared to really make your logo stand out, especially when it’s around a topic that other Discord servers may exist for. You need to make it easy for your server logo to be understood and remembered, and a bold logo is ideal.

## FAQs

#### 1\. What is a Discord Logo?

A **Discord logo** is an icon that’s associated with your Discord server. For any Discord user, the servers they’re a member of are listed by logo, so making a distinctive one that is clearly associated with your server is important for helping people to easily find the server they’re looking for.

#### 2\. What is the Best Size for Discord Channel Logos?

The size of your Discord logo is important, because if it’s too small then it means the logo will be poor quality, while if it’s too large then finer details just won’t be visible – the logo is only ever shown as a small icon. Aim for 512 x 512 pixels.

#### 3\. What is the Best Discord Logo Shape?

Discord logos are displayed as circles, so the easiest way to make sure your logo is properly displayed is to create it as a circle. If you upload a logo in a different shape, you risk having part of your logo cut off, or it being centered incorrectly.

#### 4\. How to Change the Server Logo on Discord?

When you first create your Discord server, you’ll be shown a ‘Getting started’ list where one of the actions is to personalize the server with an icon.

If you’ve already established your Discord server and no longer see this option, then you can simply right-click on your server to find a menu option for the server settings, where you’ll also find the option to update your server logo.

Discord’s a great tool for getting together with people who share your interests and sharing content, ideas and discussions. The only thing is, most people have quite a few interests, and so your server is likely to be fighting for attention amongst many other servers. Users can join up to 100, after all. So, a good **Discord server logo** is essential, as it makes it easier for your server to stand out and be found. This article will look at the best free Discord server logo makers.

* [Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker](#part1)
* [Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites](#part2)
* [Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel Tips](#part3)
* [Part 4: FAQs about Discord Logo and Icon](#part4)

## Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker

We’ve picked out some of the best free logo makers, so you can customize your own Discord server logo.

### 1  Logo.Bot

[Logo.Bot](https://www.logo.bot/) uses AI to generate your logo for you, so that you don’t need to worry about drawing anything. It can create a professional logo that you can easily download to use for your Discord server.

Firstly, it’ll ask for your ‘Company’ information – just use the name and description of your Discord server.

![Discord Logo Maker - Logo Bot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fill-in-company-info-logo-bot.jpg)

You’ll then be asked to choose a colour scheme, so pick one that is either relevant to your server or that you simply like. You can pick up at most 3 colors.

![Discord Logo Maker - Logo Bot - select color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-color-logo-bot.jpg)

Next, it’ll give you a list of icons to choose from based on your details already entered, but you can still search for new keywords if you want. Choose up to five icons.

![ Logo Bot icon Preference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-icon-preference.jpg)

Logo Bot will then generate 3 logos based on the information provided before. You can then edit your favourite options using the site’s built-in tools.

![ Logo Bot preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-preview.jpg)

Once you’re done, you can download a free version of your logo as a low-resolution JPG. The problem is that it’ll come with a watermark. If you want the version that is best suited to Discord without a watermark, you’ll need to pay a one-off fee of $20.

![ Logo Bot editing interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-editing-interface.jpg)

### 2  MyBrandNewLogo

[MyBrandNewLogo](https://mybrandnewlogo.com/) is another option that makes it simple to create Discord logos. They even have a specialist tool just for Discord. You’ll start by giving the name of your server (‘Company’) again.

![ MyBrandNewLogo interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-start-interface.jpg)

Then, you can enter some keywords to help it choose the icons to use as part of your logo.

With MyBrandNewLogo, the colour options are slightly more limited than with Logo.Bot, but you can also ask it to surprise you if you aren’t too fussed about the colour to use.

![ MyBrandNewLogo select color ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-select-color.jpg)

From there, you’ll again be shown a mix of icons and fonts combined to create a logo. You can then edit the layout of your logo, the background, add a slogan, change the icon and more to tailor it to your exact specifications.

![ MyBrandNewLogo editing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-editing-interface.jpg)

Unfortunately again you do need to sign up and pay to download your logo. A basic package with one low-res file is €20, while the Professional pack costs €50.

# A Quick Primer On What Is Discord

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord was initially launched in 2015 to provide gamers a platform where they could freely communicate and form tight-knit communities around their interests. According to a 2019 [survey](https://www.statista.com/statistics/579334/most-popular-us-social-networking-apps-ranked-by-reach/), it was ranked as the 11th most popular mobile social networking app in the US, reaching 8.03% of mobile users.

But over the last year, Discord became the go-to chat app for people from all sorts of backgrounds and niches. From like-minded Bitcoin enthusiasts to some zealous reptile lovers, you'll find all kinds of communities here.

As a result, there are currently 31,309 live [websites](https://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/Discord) that use Discord, which justifies its estimated [revenue](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/discord-statistics/) of $120 million in 2020.

The popularity of Discord has rightfully increased over the years, with its privacy features and easy-to-use interface.

Read ahead to find out what makes it better than other communication platforms out there.

## What Is Discord?

Discord has everything you need in a good communication software with its voice chats, video calls, and text options. These let users get in touch with each other, which works perfectly for gamers to form communities, coordinate, and talk while playing.

Primarily a chat app, it makes chatting while playing games on PC very convenient. However, it is not just used by gamers, as a lot of people use it as a social and organizational tool.

This past year, Discord has become the default destination for Youtubers, influencers, and Instagrammers who want to build a community around their content and connect with audiences in a more meaningful way.

## How Does Discord Work And What Can It Be Used For?

Discord is simply a communication software that allows the users to message or call one another. There are different communities on it, and each one is called a server, with individual text and voice channels for you to join. You can type, voice-chat, and share videos, links, images, music, etc.

You'll find that each channel has a unique topic or rules; for instance, one channel could be dedicated to games while another to sharing pictures of dogs, etc.

Discord serves as a social forum where people form private or public servers and discuss their shared interests. You can even start your own server if you can't find any worth joining for free. Try A Google search to find discord servers on your preferred topic or use the app's own search engine to look for a new channel.

Who doesn't like GIFs?

Discord allows you to add GIFs to your chats or mark your messages as spoilers using the "/giphy" or "/spoiler" commands, respectively.

It also lets you reach out to other people and directly message them to have a video or voice chat with them. Furthermore, it can also connect to other apps like Spotify or YouTube to improve your experience.

No matter what other activity you are doing, you can use Discord along with it. For instance, if your friends want to play a game, you can all launch the same Discord server and use any device to access it. Smack talk your friends' Mortal Combat or Street Fighter skills to your heart's content – no one's judging!

Interestingly, day traders and investors also hopped on the bandwagon because it lets them multitask and stay connected like a pro.

If these features weren't enough, Discord is also free to download and use. And if you love the experience of Discord, you can always upgrade and subscribe to Discord Nitro.

While Discord itself provides you a fantastic experience, Nitro improves it by many folds. It lets you access more features like larger file uploads, animated emojis, better-quality streaming options, and a lot more, only for $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year!

## What Makes Discord Standout?

There's a reason why Discord has managed to garner over [300 million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/746215/discord-user-number/) registered users as of June 2020\. Even though you can find many communication tools, the variety of chat options makes Discord stand out amongst others.

### 1\. Easy-To-Use Interface

Don't we all look for an easy-to-use interface in the apps or websites we use?

Discord has a good UI along with all the best features from communication apps like Slack and Skype. It also puts in a lot of effort in making the voice chat more efficient so that it is of real help while playing games.

### 2\. Provides A Social Forum

One of the best things about Discord is that it is more than just a communications software. Users actually take advantage of its chat options to meet and talk to other like-minded people making it a great social media platform.

This means that Discord isn't only good for gamers. You can use the private server to interact with friends or the public ones to make new ones.

### 3\. Setting Up Member Roles

Another one of Discord's advantage is that you can use various ways to configure its server when you create one. You can establish different roles for the community members, like making one for other moderators and administrators or special functions for the most active users.

This makes your server easier to manage, while the experience is quite rewarding for active users.

### 4\. Accessibility

As you will read below, one of the best facets of Discord is that you can use it even if you do not have a gaming PC in front of you. The web-based and mobile versions are relatively easy to use. At the same time, the downloadable PC program runs in the background while you play your games.

You can use its chat servers to interact with people from pretty much anywhere due to the multitude of platforms available.

## Where Can You Use Discord?

Whether you have Windows or Mac, you can download and use the app effortlessly.

You can also use it in-browser at its official website, though there are some limitations. For example, you won't be able to detect audio devices or a webcam and screen-sharing feature to stream desktops or windows to other people.

If you want to use it on the go, try the iOS and Android apps that offer relatively similar features as the desktop one. They have recently added the screen sharing feature to the mobile version as well making it accessible for everyone.

## How to Get Started On Discord?

Follow the guide below if you want to join Discord:

### 1\.  Creating A Discord Account

Once you have downloaded Discord on your device, click on the register link option, and create an account. Fill out the fields with relevant information, including the email you will use. Then create a username and password, and hit the "Continue" button to proceed.

Congratulations! You've entered the world of Discord. Do check your email to verify your account so you can enjoy the full functionality of this app. In case you haven't received it, click the resend button.

### 2\.  Joining A Server

Creating your account is just the beginning. Let's get to the most exciting bit, which is joining a server!

First and foremost, find the perfect server to join as there are many resources available. You can find different server communities through the search option. You can optimize your search by typing in a keyword to find one focused on a topic of your interest.

You will see servers pop up once you type in your keyword. Just click on the display card of the one that's in line with your interests. It's also possible to view the server before you join, and if you like it, you can select the "Join Server" option.

A little icon near the magnifying glass and the plus signs on the screen will be added representing the server you have joined; click on it to rejoin the server whenever you want.

### 3\.  Adding Friends

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord was initially launched in 2015 to provide gamers a platform where they could freely communicate and form tight-knit communities around their interests. According to a 2019 [survey](https://www.statista.com/statistics/579334/most-popular-us-social-networking-apps-ranked-by-reach/), it was ranked as the 11th most popular mobile social networking app in the US, reaching 8.03% of mobile users.

But over the last year, Discord became the go-to chat app for people from all sorts of backgrounds and niches. From like-minded Bitcoin enthusiasts to some zealous reptile lovers, you'll find all kinds of communities here.

As a result, there are currently 31,309 live [websites](https://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/Discord) that use Discord, which justifies its estimated [revenue](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/discord-statistics/) of $120 million in 2020.

The popularity of Discord has rightfully increased over the years, with its privacy features and easy-to-use interface.

## What Is Discord?

Discord has everything you need in a good communication software with its voice chats, video calls, and text options. These let users get in touch with each other, which works perfectly for gamers to form communities, coordinate, and talk while playing.

Primarily a chat app, it makes chatting while playing games on PC very convenient. However, it is not just used by gamers, as a lot of people use it as a social and organizational tool.

This past year, Discord has become the default destination for Youtubers, influencers, and Instagrammers who want to build a community around their content and connect with audiences in a more meaningful way.

## How Does Discord Work And What Can It Be Used For?

Discord is simply a communication software that allows the users to message or call one another. There are different communities on it, and each one is called a server, with individual text and voice channels for you to join. You can type, voice-chat, and share videos, links, images, music, etc.

You'll find that each channel has a unique topic or rules; for instance, one channel could be dedicated to games while another to sharing pictures of dogs, etc.

Discord serves as a social forum where people form private or public servers and discuss their shared interests. You can even start your own server if you can't find any worth joining for free. Try A Google search to find discord servers on your preferred topic or use the app's own search engine to look for a new channel.

Who doesn't like GIFs?

Discord allows you to add GIFs to your chats or mark your messages as spoilers using the "/giphy" or "/spoiler" commands, respectively.

It also lets you reach out to other people and directly message them to have a video or voice chat with them. Furthermore, it can also connect to other apps like Spotify or YouTube to improve your experience.

No matter what other activity you are doing, you can use Discord along with it. For instance, if your friends want to play a game, you can all launch the same Discord server and use any device to access it. Smack talk your friends' Mortal Combat or Street Fighter skills to your heart's content – no one's judging!

Interestingly, day traders and investors also hopped on the bandwagon because it lets them multitask and stay connected like a pro.

If these features weren't enough, Discord is also free to download and use. And if you love the experience of Discord, you can always upgrade and subscribe to Discord Nitro.

While Discord itself provides you a fantastic experience, Nitro improves it by many folds. It lets you access more features like larger file uploads, animated emojis, better-quality streaming options, and a lot more, only for $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year!

## What Makes Discord Standout?

There's a reason why Discord has managed to garner over [300 million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/746215/discord-user-number/) registered users as of June 2020\. Even though you can find many communication tools, the variety of chat options makes Discord stand out amongst others.

### 1\. Easy-To-Use Interface

Don't we all look for an easy-to-use interface in the apps or websites we use?

Discord has a good UI along with all the best features from communication apps like Slack and Skype. It also puts in a lot of effort in making the voice chat more efficient so that it is of real help while playing games.

### 2\. Provides A Social Forum

One of the best things about Discord is that it is more than just a communications software. Users actually take advantage of its chat options to meet and talk to other like-minded people making it a great social media platform.

This means that Discord isn't only good for gamers. You can use the private server to interact with friends or the public ones to make new ones.

### 3\. Setting Up Member Roles

Another one of Discord's advantage is that you can use various ways to configure its server when you create one. You can establish different roles for the community members, like making one for other moderators and administrators or special functions for the most active users.

This makes your server easier to manage, while the experience is quite rewarding for active users.

### 4\. Accessibility

As you will read below, one of the best facets of Discord is that you can use it even if you do not have a gaming PC in front of you. The web-based and mobile versions are relatively easy to use. At the same time, the downloadable PC program runs in the background while you play your games.

You can use its chat servers to interact with people from pretty much anywhere due to the multitude of platforms available.

## Where Can You Use Discord?

Whether you have Windows or Mac, you can download and use the app effortlessly.

You can also use it in-browser at its official website, though there are some limitations. For example, you won't be able to detect audio devices or a webcam and screen-sharing feature to stream desktops or windows to other people.

If you want to use it on the go, try the iOS and Android apps that offer relatively similar features as the desktop one. They have recently added the screen sharing feature to the mobile version as well making it accessible for everyone.

## How to Get Started On Discord?

Follow the guide below if you want to join Discord:

### 1\.  Creating A Discord Account

Once you have downloaded Discord on your device, click on the register link option, and create an account. Fill out the fields with relevant information, including the email you will use. Then create a username and password, and hit the "Continue" button to proceed.

Congratulations! You've entered the world of Discord. Do check your email to verify your account so you can enjoy the full functionality of this app. In case you haven't received it, click the resend button.

### 2\.  Joining A Server

Creating your account is just the beginning. Let's get to the most exciting bit, which is joining a server!

First and foremost, find the perfect server to join as there are many resources available. You can find different server communities through the search option. You can optimize your search by typing in a keyword to find one focused on a topic of your interest.

You will see servers pop up once you type in your keyword. Just click on the display card of the one that's in line with your interests. It's also possible to view the server before you join, and if you like it, you can select the "Join Server" option.

A little icon near the magnifying glass and the plus signs on the screen will be added representing the server you have joined; click on it to rejoin the server whenever you want.

### 3\.  Adding Friends

Adding friends is another exciting part of Discord, which is luckily very straightforward. Follow the easy guide to do so.

In the "Friends" tab, you can see options on the dashboard. Click on the green "Add friend" button to add someone. A screen will appear that will ask you to enter a friend's username and #number. Press the "Send Friend Request" option after this, and you would have added your first friend!
