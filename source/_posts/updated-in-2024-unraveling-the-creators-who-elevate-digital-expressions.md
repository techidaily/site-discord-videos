4. Adjust your screen resolution and frame rates according to your choice
5. After youâ€™ve made all the adjustments, you can hit the â€˜Go Liveâ€™ button at the bottom right of the window to start streaming.

If you wish to stop streaming, click on the â€˜Stop Streamingâ€™ icon at the app's bottom-left corner

Additionally, if you wish to stream voice and video calls on your Discord server, you can do so as well. To make a call to your friends through Discord:

Discord allows for streaming through its Windows desktop client. You can stream games, podcasts, and any other kind of content through it.

However, it is crucial to remember that you can only stream in 480p and 720p resolutions in the free version. If you want higher resolution streaming, subscribe to Discord Nitro, which costs $9.99 a month.

4. Adjust your screen resolution and frame rates according to your choice
5. After youâ€™ve made all the adjustments, you can hit the â€˜Go Liveâ€™ button at the bottom right of the window to start streaming.

If you wish to stop streaming, click on the â€˜Stop Streamingâ€™ icon at the app's bottom-left corner

Additionally, if you wish to stream voice and video calls on your Discord server, you can do so as well. To make a call to your friends through Discord:

1. Open the Discord app on your Windows PC and then select the server you want to use
2. Click the General Voice channel to place a voice connection with Discord
3. On the bottom left of the window, you will see a Voice Connected entry. If you wish to video call, click on the â€˜Videoâ€™ button; otherwise, click on the â€˜Screenâ€™ button for screen sharing
4. When you click â€˜Video,â€™ your screenâ€™s center will switch to conversation mode, and you will be able to see your camera feed
5. If you click on the screen, a pop-up window shows up, allowing you to select the application you want to share
6. After setting this up, your friends can join your call by clicking on the General channel

When you want to end the call, click on the red Disconnect icon
