# How to Get and Add Animated Emojis on Discord

If you love talking to your friends online, chances are that you love emojis and can't stop using them. At least that's the case for everyone on Discord!

It isn't surprising to see that the community has fallen in love with Discord animated emojis. These can be crafted and used in ways that haven't been done before.

That's why it makes sense for businesses, especially in the gaming industry, to push the use of Discord animated emojis due to its popularity.

However, know their limitations before you use them. For example, only 50 animated Discord emojis are allowed per server, and a custom Discord animated emoji should be a particular size.
Other than these issues, the sky is the limit to what you can do with an animated emoticon on Discord.

Note: If you want to [add animated emojis to videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you should definitely try Wondershare Filmora video editor, which features lots of animated emojis.

## Part 1: How to Get Animated Emojis with Discord Nitro?

Discord Nitro is the subscription-based, super-powered version of Discord that allows users to access various paid features that you won't get with the regular Discord account. The monthly subscription costs $4.99 only.

Nitro supports all types of emoticons, including Discords animated emojis, at no additional cost. You won't even see the option for using these if you aren't paid Nitro subscriber.

![Discord Nitro Benefits](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/discord-emoji-nitro.png)

So once you've subscribed to Nitro, you can use a shortcode within chat such as ': grinning' or click the emoji icon to the right side of the designated chatbox to use the animated Discord emojis.

Select your desired animated Discord emoji from the popup window that shows animated emojis available to your account. Standard users will only see the regular emojis in this section.

## Part 2: How to Get Animated Emojis on Discord without Nitro?

Here are several ways to get Discord animated emojis and add them to the Discord server without going Nitro:

### Method 1: Download Animated Emojis and Upload them to the Discord Server

Animated Discord emojis make it a lot more convenient and easy to express your feelings. You can find and download them at these websites:

#### 1. [Emoji.gg](https://emoji.gg/category/8/animated)

Emoji.gg is a simple website that provides a range of animated Discord emojis for free.

The itinerary is labelled by category, but you can also download the best ones together as a pack.

![Get Discord Emojis from Emoji.gg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojigg-discord-animated-emojis.jpg)

Emoji.gg can connect directly with Discord, allowing users to use their preferred animated Discord emoji directly from their site. You can also use this website to create custom animated Discord emojis using the Maker option.

#### 2. [Animated Emojis](https://www.animatedemojis.com/)

This is another excellent website that will let you download animated Discord emojis.

They have a massive database of Discords animated emojis listed in alphabetic order. The website's user interface makes navigation easy, so you can find the perfect emoticon from the thousands in their database.

![Get Discord Emojis from Animated Emojis ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojigg-discord-animated-emojis.jpg)

You will have to click the download button to download them from the website. Though to use the animated Discord emojis, they must be uploaded to Discord separately.

To do that:

* Go to your Discord Server
* Click "Settings"
* Click "Emojis"
* Click "Upload"

#### 3. [Discord.st](https://discord.st/emojis/?cat=animated)

Discord.st is a website that offers animated Discord emojis as well as the ability to share your favorite animated Discord emojis with your friends.

However, these emoticons can't be downloaded from the website to your device. Instead, you can log in with your Discord credentials and use them.

![Get Discord Emojis from Discord.st](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-street-emoji.jpg)

You also have the option to create your customized animated Discord emojis here.

### Method 2: Add Animated Emojis Bots to Discord Server

An animated emoji bot can definitely make it easier to find and use the right emoticons on your Discord server. Here's what you'll need to add this functionality to your chats:

#### 1. NQN

[NQN](https://nqn.blue/) is a Discord bot that allows anyone to use animated Discord emojis, and it’s completely free.

![Get Discord Emojis from NQN](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nqn-not-quite-nitro.jpg)

* You will have to invite NQN bot to your Discord server. After that, once the NQN bot is connected with your server, you will be able to see the bot in your messages.
* Go to messages and type !packsearch to search for animated Discord emoji packs.
* To add the animated Discord emoji pack, click the plus sign in the message box, or to view another pack click the arrow icon.
* To search a pack by name, type !packsearch(name of the pack).
* When you've found the Discord animated emoji pack that you want, type !packsave(name of the pack) in the chatbox.
* A message will come in the message box; click the tick sign below it.
* Now, go to the emoji section on Discord. You will see your animated Discord emojis being downloaded.

#### 2. Top.gg

This is another cool bot that allows you to add animated Discord emojis to your server.

Again, as NQN, you will have to invite the bot and add it to your Discord server. After that, you will see the bot in messages, and you can use the steps mentioned above as guidance.

![ Get Discord Emojis from NQN](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nqn-not-quite-nitro.jpg)

The following features clearly stand out:

* **Use animated emojis in messages**: Write an emoji code :spinthink: > And the bot will create
* **Animated emojis as reactions**: n!react spinthink > React to last message with (n!help react for more)
* **Add more Emojis:** Go to your Discord Server > "Settings" > "Emojis" > Click "Upload"

On Discord, users can communicate by directly messaging another user or creating a group chat. But the most common and best way is to create servers where everyone gets together and has fun.

To manage these servers and the members, and to provide more facilities, there are a lot of bots that provide a variety of features from user management to entertainment and music and more. A bot is basically a programmed Discord account that can be added to multiple servers and then provides certain functions to the members in that server using commands.
