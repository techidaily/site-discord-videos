## **Part 1: What Does the Discord Statuses Mean?**

Discord status is a changeable notification setting that enables users to set their current condition either AFK, online, or custom! This status consists of four options (online, Idle, Do not disturb, Invisible, and Custom) which will be explained below.

![default discord status options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/default-discord-status.jpg)

**Online:**

The default status of all Discord accounts is the Online mode! This mode allows you to receive instant notifications and show up in your contact list normally. It's indicated by a small green circle in your profile photo.

**Idle**:

The Idle mode is the same as the online status, though this status usually comes up automatically when you're away from the keyboard for a while, and it turns off as soon there's a movement within the Discord platform. In contrast, if the Idle status is set manually, you'll have to put it to online status yourself, and it's signified with a moon-shaped icon on your profile photo.

**Do not disturb:**

Do Not Disturb, also known as DND mode, disables all notifications from the Discord app, and it's indicated using a red status on your profile photo.

**Invisible:**

Invisible Mode allows you to use Discord while appearing Offline to other members, although the typing indicator will be displayed to your contact while typing. It's indicated with a gray icon on your profile.

**Custom:**

Custom status enables you to add messages that you want to be displayed on your profile. You can add up to a 128 character text limit, including emojis.

## **Part 2: How Do You Make and Get Custom Status on Discord?**

As I said before, Discord custom status enables you to add messages you want to display on your discord profile. And many folks use it as a means of letting their contacts know the service they offer. Also, this Custom status option will allow you to add emojis as you like. The text limit is 128 characters!

Anyway, creating a custom status is as easy as plucking a low hanging fruit. All you've got to do is follow the steps below to set your status on discord to custom.

Step 1: Click on the profile icon located at the bottom left corner of the pane, you'll see four preset statuses to select from ( Online, Idle, Do not disturb, Invisible)! This time, you'll choose **Set a custom status**.

Afterward, select how long you want the new custom message to display on your status from the drop-down list (Clear tomorrow, Clear in 4 hours, Clear in 1 hour, Clear in 30 minutes, Don't clear) and click Save to finalize the operation.

Yeah!! Now your status has been changed to custom!
