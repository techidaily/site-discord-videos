Better Discord is a great extension used by many people around the globe, but it violates the Discord ToS and can cause security issues. It's commonly used for Discord plugins and themes but not yet legally allowed.

**2 – Is better discord a virus?**

Better Discord is an application or website platform very similar to Discord. However, the users are a bit concerned about using this application as they suspect that installing better discord is just a way of getting viruses inside your computer. However, users use better discord at their own risk as Discord is not officially synced with it.

**3 – Are better discord plugins safe?**

Better Discord itself is pretty safe to use. However, you must be alert for 3rd party themes as they may affect your PC with malware or virus. To prevent this situation, you must download themes only from the official server of Better Discord.
