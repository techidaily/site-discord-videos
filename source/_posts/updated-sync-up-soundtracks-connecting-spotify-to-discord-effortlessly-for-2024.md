Discord is a popular chat app explicitly designed for socializing. You can use it to remain connected, share screen space, and even listen to music along with friends and other users.

While Discord allows you to add a music bot to any server with relative ease, you can also add your Spotify account to it and show friends what you’re listening to via your Discord status.

With this exciting feature, all your friends can discover the music you play, listen along to it, and even see what you’re up to.

So, if you’re wondering how to connect Spotify to Discord, here’s your answer.

## Part 1: How to Link Spotify To Discord on Windows PC/Mac Directly

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Linking Spotify to Discord on windows PC/Mac is relatively easy. Just follow the steps below:

1. Turn your computer on and launch your discord app, or you can sign into the web-browser version instead
2. Click on the User Settings option in your discord app — one with a small gear icon placed at the lower right corner of the screen, alongside your username
3. Within the User Settings, you’ll see a Connections section atop the left-sidebar; click it. All accounts that are connected to the discord account are visible here
4. Now, click the Spotify icon below the Connect Your Accounts option. A new window will appear in the browser; you can sign in to the Spotify account using your username and password or your Facebook account. Once you log in, connect Spotify to Discord

As you allow your Spotify account to connect to Discord, the connections tab will show Spotify and Discord are connected.

It will also display a badge on your Discord profile, which shows your Spotify username (if you like, you can also turn this off via the connections menu).

![Connect  Spotify to  Discord and set as status](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-spotify-as-status-on-discord.jpg)

By default, whenever you’ll play some music on Spotify using the same PC/Mac you are signed in to your Discord account, the status will suddenly change into “listening to Spotify.”

Users can see what tracks you are playing by simply clicking your name. Not just that, but they can also play the same tracks on their Mac or PC and even “listen along.”

This facility will let your friends tune into and listen to the same thing you’re listening to! If you want to, you can turn off this setting via the Connections menu.

Lastly, you can also click this plus (+) sign near to chat box and choose the option ‘Invite to listen to Spotify.’ This will send users links, allowing them to join you via the “listen along” feature.
