Discord is one of the fastest-growing instant communication platforms. It started as just a messaging and [voice chat app for gamers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) but today it has expanded into every PC. From gaming to just general chatting, it is used by everyone. Discord also provides bots and features to expand the user's experience. One of the types of bots that are available on Discord servers is music bots.

This article covers everything you need to know about Discord Music Bots:

* [Part 1: What is Discord Music Bot?](#part1)
* [Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Add a Music Bot to Discord?](#part3)
* [Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?](#part4)
* [Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?](#bonus) \[Free to Use\]

## Part 1: What is Discord Music Bot?

Discord allows users to create servers where they can then invite their friends or people who have the same interest, or people playing the same game. Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.

**Discord music bots** provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time. Discord music bots can find songs on YouTube, Spotify, or other platforms and play them on a Discord voice channel.

## Part 3: How to Add a Music Bot to Discord?

Adding a music bot to your server is very simple and only takes one click. Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.

This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.

Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.

After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members' area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.

## Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?

Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.

Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type _–help_ for Groovy and similarly for every other bot (\[specified prefix\]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.

Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.

You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the _–loop track_ command. And loop your whole queue using –_loop queue_. You can turn the loop off by –_loop off_.

If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the _–queue_ command.

In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.

## Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?

Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use [Filmore Discord video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size.

## Part 3: How to Add a Music Bot to Discord?

Adding a music bot to your server is very simple and only takes one click. Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.

This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.

Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.

After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members' area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.

## Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?

Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.

Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type _–help_ for Groovy and similarly for every other bot (\[specified prefix\]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.

Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.

You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the _–loop track_ command. And loop your whole queue using –_loop queue_. You can turn the loop off by –_loop off_.

If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the _–queue_ command.

In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.

## Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?

Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use [Filmore Discord video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size.

## Part 1: What is Discord Music Bot?

Discord allows users to create servers where they can then invite their friends or people who have the same interest, or people playing the same game. Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.

**Discord music bots** provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time. Discord music bots can find songs on YouTube, Spotify, or other platforms and play them on a Discord voice channel.

### 7. BMO [](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/418412306981191680)

This Music bot was inspired by the Adventure-Time Character BMO. This music bot is fun to use and provides the functionality of a high level of bot.

It is the best bot, in my opinion, to liven up your server especially if it has a general chat room.

**Pros**

* Smooth lag-free High-Quality Music.
* Small chat games to make a user's time on your server more fun.
* NSFW commands for those channels as well.
* The bot is also DMCA protected which means it’s not violating any copyright laws.

### 8. 24/7 [](https://24-7music.com)

24/7 is another one of my favorite free music bots. It not only provides high-quality music streaming from major websites like YouTube, Spotify, and mixer. But it also allows streaming from any radio station around the world.

24/7 was created by Deluxe to provide non-stop music for its users. It has a small number of commands to keep it concise and to the point.

* mb play \[link to internet radio stream\]
* mb pause \*
* mb resume \*
* mb np
* mb volume \[volume percentage\] \*
* mb help

_\[\] = optional parameter_

_\* = premium only commands_

The premium version can be bought for $2.47 which along with the commands unlocks these features:

#### Premium features of 24/7

\- YouTube queue, including pause, resume, skip, add, remove, export, import, etc.

\- YouTube playlist support

\- control the volume, server-wide

But if you like the bot you can get the $7.24 version which provides all the above-mentioned benefits and a message on your server stating that you donated to the creators of this bot.

**Pros**

The Best thing about 24/7 is that it can stream any live event from Youtube as well. So, you can listen to a talk show, a podcast, or any other live event while playing your favorite games.

### 9. [Mantaro](https://mantaro.site/)

A personal favorite that I have on my server is Mantaro. It, like all the bots mentioned before, provides great quality music streaming from all major sources.

This bot is the go-to for an anime lover or an anime discord server. It comes with everything you need to make it fun, lively, and interactive even when people aren’t playing games and just chatting.

**Pros**

* Mantaro has so many features. From a currency system to mining activities, gifts, XP, chopping, fishing, pets, and everything.
* Birthday roles and announcements.
* Games (such as trivia, guess the character, guess the number, and guess the Pokémon _remember that on the TV back then?_)
* Anime and Character lookup command. And don’t forget the NSFW commands for lewd anime pics.
* It also provides RP commands for all the RP lovers out there.

Mantaro makes your server into more of a second life for you.

### 10. [ErisBot](https://erisbot.com/)

ErisBot is a strong and very simple-to-use music bot.

The best feature about ErisBot that separates it from the rest is that it allows you to create your very own custom prefixes for the commands.

One thing I noticed is that sometimes instead of playing audio from the YouTube link, it starts playing the video. Maybe it mixes up the commands or whatever. This is something you’ll have to keep in mind while using Eris Bot.

But if you like the bot you can get the $7.24 version which provides all the above-mentioned benefits and a message on your server stating that you donated to the creators of this bot.

**Pros**

The Best thing about 24/7 is that it can stream any live event from Youtube as well. So, you can listen to a talk show, a podcast, or any other live event while playing your favorite games.

### 9. [Mantaro](https://mantaro.site/)

A personal favorite that I have on my server is Mantaro. It, like all the bots mentioned before, provides great quality music streaming from all major sources.

This bot is the go-to for an anime lover or an anime discord server. It comes with everything you need to make it fun, lively, and interactive even when people aren’t playing games and just chatting.

**Pros**

* Mantaro has so many features. From a currency system to mining activities, gifts, XP, chopping, fishing, pets, and everything.
* Birthday roles and announcements.
* Games (such as trivia, guess the character, guess the number, and guess the Pokémon _remember that on the TV back then?_)
* Anime and Character lookup command. And don’t forget the NSFW commands for lewd anime pics.
* It also provides RP commands for all the RP lovers out there.

Mantaro makes your server into more of a second life for you.

### 10. [ErisBot](https://erisbot.com/)

ErisBot is a strong and very simple-to-use music bot.

The best feature about ErisBot that separates it from the rest is that it allows you to create your very own custom prefixes for the commands.

One thing I noticed is that sometimes instead of playing audio from the YouTube link, it starts playing the video. Maybe it mixes up the commands or whatever. This is something you’ll have to keep in mind while using Eris Bot.

## Part 3: How to Add a Music Bot to Discord?

Adding a music bot to your server is very simple and only takes one click. Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.

This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.

Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.

After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members' area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.

## Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?

Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.

Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type _–help_ for Groovy and similarly for every other bot (\[specified prefix\]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.

Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.

You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the _–loop track_ command. And loop your whole queue using –_loop queue_. You can turn the loop off by –_loop off_.

If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the _–queue_ command.

In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.

## Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?

Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use [Filmore Discord video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size. Filmora owns popular video effects and filters to make your video look professional, plus, it possesses a huge library that offers multiple music tracks for you to use.

See how powerful the Filmora is!

## Best Free Online Discord Emoji Makers

Is there anything better than a free website that allows you to create an emoji to express your true feelings in your own style?

Here are three free Discord emoji maker online tools you might want to try out:

### 1\.  Kapwing

[Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/explore/128x128-custom-discord-emote-maker) is a custom Discord emote maker that provides you with all the necessary tools and features required to make an emoji.

Remember, Discord has a strict image size policy, so set your image to 128x128 pixels when building your emoji.

The layout allows you to edit your picture and turn it into a Discord emote easily, ensuring that it's the right size and dimensions. The tool also provides you with various options to make your emoji just the way you want it.

Once you've made your emoji all that is left is to upload it to your Discord server. Here's how to do that:

* Head up to your server where you want to upload the emoji,
* Select the down-arrow next to the server's name in the Discord screen's top-left corner.
* You'll find an option of server settings; choosing would lead you to a list of other options.
* Select the Emojis options in the left sidebar
* Click on the "Upload Emoji" bar.

To know more about getting and adding emojis to your Discord server, [read this](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/how-to-make-discord-emotes/).

## Best Discord Emoji Making Apps for iPhone and Android

The good thing about Discord is that it's for everyone, regardless of the platform, device, or OS they may be using.

These Discord emoji maker applications are easy to use, intelligently designed, and, best of all, can be used on both iPhone and Android devices:

### 1\.  BITMOJI

With over 3 million downloads, Bitmoji is a top-rated application that's also linked with Snapchat.

It is the go-to app for teenagers and is considered one of the best and most popular third-party applications over the last year.

 The highly-customizable emojis created via this app could be your alter-egos because you can make them look just like you, making conversing highly interactive and fun.

Using Bitmoji is easy and straightforward. While the application earlier required you to create an avatar or an emoji from scratch, it now offers the option of selecting a picture and generating emojis and stickers.

 You can make changes or adjustments to your emoji if it's not what you imagined it to be. You may do this by directly customizing the appearance of your avatar. That includes changing hair, color, size or shape, and much more.

Furthermore, with Bitmoji you can:

* Create an expressive avatar
* Choose from a vast library of emojis

### 2\.  ZMOJI

This application is the perfect fit for you if you want to create and easily share customizable emojis with your friends. This is also used as a Discord emoji maker, but it may remind old users of the Bitmoji application, where you had no automated guidance.

You were left clear to experiment and use your creativity to start in and make emojis for yourself from scratch.

There is almost nothing in the application that you are not able to adjust.

This includes changing or adjusting the avatar features such as eyebrows and hairstyle to face type and clothing.

Once you've created ZMoji emojis for yourself, you can download them and send them over to your Discord server for upload.

ZMoji keyboard, an extension of the ZMoji application, is a must if you love animated emojis. It offers an extensive range of stickers, and you won't run out of options anytime soon.

However, some users might find that the biggest drawback of ZMoji is the number of ads on the platform and that the cost of a premium subscription is a touch more expensive.

![discord emoji maker on mobile - ZMOJI](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/discord-emoji-maker-5.jpg)

### 3\.  EMOJILY

Another exciting Discord emote maker application that works as an emoji maker is Emojily.

The application offers several different designs to make your unique emoji and emoticon. You can label your emojis in many categories and find the perfect features such as eyes, eyebrows, mouths, hands, clothes, and even hats.

Users also appreciate the ability to directly share it to other platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Kik, or upload it to your Discord server is appreciated by users.

The standout feature of Emojly is a feature that they term a super feature called the randomize feature. It is designed to act as an automated super crazy creator and maker! This feature generates random emojis based on the labels decided by you. Pretty cool, right?

With Emojily, you have all the tools available to run your creativity wild and make the best emoji present.

While The Create Emoji is a free, customized extension of Emojily, you can only access limited elements in the free version. You may wish to subscribe to the paid version to establish more control over the design. Doing this will allow you to enjoy the more extensive experience Emojily has to offer.

## Conclusion

Making your emojis might sound like a difficult task, especially for Discord, but **Discord emoji maker** applications make the process fun and straightforward.

Popular apps like Bitmoji or MakeEmoji can create stickers or avatars. In contrast, Emojily and similar apps can be used to quickly make some detailed emotes.

All of these are incredibly well designed online tools and apps to make your experience of building your emoji a pleasant and worthwhile experience.
