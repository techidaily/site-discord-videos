<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Discord is a voice and text chat service <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to bring like-minded people together, especially e-sports professionals.</p>
<p>The goal was to provide users with an improved communications platform that could streamline the way people speak in real-time and over the internet.</p>
<p>Originally designed for gamers, the app allowed users to communicate with others who share interests on a given topic.</p>
<p>After a while, the Discord app expanded its reach and included non-gamers as well. Today, it is one of the most popular chatting apps out there.</p>
<p>However, if, for any reason, you want to delete or disable your account for good, you can. In the following articles, you will learn about how to delete your account step by step.</p>

No problem! If you want to learn how to delete your discord account, look no further.</p>
<p>But before doing so, you’ll have to do two quick things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reassign ‘administrative rights’ of the servers</li>
<li>Completely delete them</li>
</ul>
<p>The only reason you will have to think about these things is if you assumed responsibility for any server.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are some easy to follow steps to delete a Discord account permanently:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Discord app</li>
<li>Sign in to your Discord account and open the user settings option (Cog icon)</li>
</ol>

                      alt="How to Delete Discord Account - Go to My Account"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Click the “My Account” option in the user setting menu. At the very bottom of the screen, you’ll see the “delete account” option</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-delete-account-option.jpg"
                      alt="Delete Discord Account Permantely - Account Options"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Click the delete account button to make your Discord account disappear!</li>
</ol>
<p>However, if you’ve activated 2FA, you may also be asked to put your password and 2FA code.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to delete your account permanently, there are some things you need to do before completing the process.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, if you’re the server’s owner, you’ll have to either delete your server or transfer its ownership to a trusted source.</p>
<p>For transferring ownership on Discord, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Discord app</li>
<li>Click the “server name,” and a range of options will open; then click “server setting”</li>
<li>At the bottom-left of the screen, click the ‘members’ option below “User Management”</li>
<li>Here you’ll make the critical decision of who gets the keys to your kingdom. Once you decide who to transfer the ownership to, click the “3 vertical dots”</li>
<li>As the “dialog menu” opens, click “Transfer Ownership”</li>
</ol>
<p>Once it’s completed, you’ll become a regular server member. Your access to the server will be limited and as per the set position.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you don’t want to transfer its ownership to someone else, you can also delete it.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can delete the server to complete the process of deleting your Discord account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the “Server Name” again</li>
<li>Within the several options, click the “Server Settings.”</li>
<li>At the bottom-left of your window, click the “Delete Server” option in the “User Management” section.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-discord-server-account.jpg"
                      alt="Delete Discord Server to Delete Account"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Once clicked, the system will ask you to enter the account password to delete your server (or servers) from existence altogether</li>
</ol>
<p>Like the primary Discord account deletion process, if you have enabled 2FA on this account, you’ll have to put in the code to get things completed.</p>
<p>After this, you’ll be asked one more time to click the “delete server” button before it is completely deleted. Keep in mind that you’ll have 14 days time to recover your Discord account. Once the two-week time passes, you won’t be able to retrieve or sign in to your account.</p>
<p>Once the account is deleted, the username will show up as “deleteduser 0000” or something similar to this. However, users you have texted via your account will still see your texts.</p>

And if you’re wondering how to delete a Discord account, Here’s a quick way to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your updated discord app and tap the “hamburger” menu located at the top-left</li>
<li>Tap the gear icon so you can go to the “user settings.”</li>
<li>Select “My Account”</li>
<li>Below the “Account Management” option, choose “Delete Account” and put your password and 2FA (if you have set it up)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Disable-Discord-Account-On-Desktop-Computer"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Disable-Discord-Account-On-Desktop-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Disable Discord Account On Desktop Computer?"></a>Part 3: How To Disable Discord Account On Desktop Computer?</h2><p>Deleting the account means you won’t be able to use it further, whereas disabling the account normally means you’re taking a little break.</p>
<p>So, if you don’t want to remove or delete your account entirely but only want it gone for some time, choose the disable option.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can disable a Discord account on a desktop computer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the app on your window PC&#x2F;Mac and then log in to your Discord account</li>
<li>Click the “User Settings” option and then go to the “My Account” option within the user settings</li>
<li>In the lower corner of your Mac&#x2F;PC screen, you’ll see the “Disable Account” button next to the “Delete Account” button</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently, there is no direct way to either delete or disable your Discord account through a mobile device.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, follow the steps below to disable your Discord account on mobile:</p>
<ol>

<li>Tap the cog icon on the lower right corner of the phone</li>
<li>Tap on the “My Account” option in the “User Settings” menu</li>

<li>To complete disabling process from a mobile device, you’ll have to send a request to the support team, as it’s the only way to disable your account via your smartphone</li>

No problem! If you want to learn how to delete your discord account, look no further.</p>
<p>But before doing so, you’ll have to do two quick things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reassign ‘administrative rights’ of the servers</li>
<li>Completely delete them</li>
</ul>
<p>The only reason you will have to think about these things is if you assumed responsibility for any server.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are some easy to follow steps to delete a Discord account permanently:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Discord app</li>
<li>Sign in to your Discord account and open the user settings option (Cog icon)</li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Click the “My Account” option in the user setting menu. At the very bottom of the screen, you’ll see the “delete account” option</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Click the delete account button to make your Discord account disappear!</li>
</ol>
<p>However, if you’ve activated 2FA, you may also be asked to put your password and 2FA code.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to delete your account permanently, there are some things you need to do before completing the process.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, if you’re the server’s owner, you’ll have to either delete your server or transfer its ownership to a trusted source.</p>
<p>For transferring ownership on Discord, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Discord app</li>
<li>Click the “server name,” and a range of options will open; then click “server setting”</li>
<li>At the bottom-left of the screen, click the ‘members’ option below “User Management”</li>
<li>Here you’ll make the critical decision of who gets the keys to your kingdom. Once you decide who to transfer the ownership to, click the “3 vertical dots”</li>
<li>As the “dialog menu” opens, click “Transfer Ownership”</li>
</ol>
<p>Once it’s completed, you’ll become a regular server member. Your access to the server will be limited and as per the set position.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you don’t want to transfer its ownership to someone else, you can also delete it.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can delete the server to complete the process of deleting your Discord account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the “Server Name” again</li>
<li>Within the several options, click the “Server Settings.”</li>
<li>At the bottom-left of your window, click the “Delete Server” option in the “User Management” section.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Delete Discord Server to Delete Account"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Once clicked, the system will ask you to enter the account password to delete your server (or servers) from existence altogether</li>
</ol>
<p>Like the primary Discord account deletion process, if you have enabled 2FA on this account, you’ll have to put in the code to get things completed.</p>
<p>After this, you’ll be asked one more time to click the “delete server” button before it is completely deleted. Keep in mind that you’ll have 14 days time to recover your Discord account. Once the two-week time passes, you won’t be able to retrieve or sign in to your account.</p>
<p>Once the account is deleted, the username will show up as “deleteduser 0000” or something similar to this. However, users you have texted via your account will still see your texts.</p>

No problem! If you want to learn how to delete your discord account, look no further.</p>
<p>But before doing so, you’ll have to do two quick things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reassign ‘administrative rights’ of the servers</li>
<li>Completely delete them</li>
</ul>
<p>The only reason you will have to think about these things is if you assumed responsibility for any server.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are some easy to follow steps to delete a Discord account permanently:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Discord app</li>
<li>Sign in to your Discord account and open the user settings option (Cog icon)</li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Click the “My Account” option in the user setting menu. At the very bottom of the screen, you’ll see the “delete account” option</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Delete Discord Account Permantely - Account Options"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Click the delete account button to make your Discord account disappear!</li>
</ol>
<p>However, if you’ve activated 2FA, you may also be asked to put your password and 2FA code.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to delete your account permanently, there are some things you need to do before completing the process.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, if you’re the server’s owner, you’ll have to either delete your server or transfer its ownership to a trusted source.</p>
<p>For transferring ownership on Discord, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Discord app</li>
<li>Click the “server name,” and a range of options will open; then click “server setting”</li>
<li>At the bottom-left of the screen, click the ‘members’ option below “User Management”</li>
<li>Here you’ll make the critical decision of who gets the keys to your kingdom. Once you decide who to transfer the ownership to, click the “3 vertical dots”</li>
<li>As the “dialog menu” opens, click “Transfer Ownership”</li>
</ol>
<p>Once it’s completed, you’ll become a regular server member. Your access to the server will be limited and as per the set position.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you don’t want to transfer its ownership to someone else, you can also delete it.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can delete the server to complete the process of deleting your Discord account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the “Server Name” again</li>
<li>Within the several options, click the “Server Settings.”</li>
<li>At the bottom-left of your window, click the “Delete Server” option in the “User Management” section.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Delete Discord Server to Delete Account"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Once clicked, the system will ask you to enter the account password to delete your server (or servers) from existence altogether</li>
</ol>
<p>Like the primary Discord account deletion process, if you have enabled 2FA on this account, you’ll have to put in the code to get things completed.</p>
<p>After this, you’ll be asked one more time to click the “delete server” button before it is completely deleted. Keep in mind that you’ll have 14 days time to recover your Discord account. Once the two-week time passes, you won’t be able to retrieve or sign in to your account.</p>
<p>Once the account is deleted, the username will show up as “deleteduser 0000” or something similar to this. However, users you have texted via your account will still see your texts.</p>

<p>A part of the appeal of the popular multimedia messaging platform Discord is that users can assume online identities that present them in a favorable light. Since Discord serves to enable groups of friends or people with shared interests to communicate in real-time, standing out from the crowd and establishing a well-known and well-liked persona can be very challenging. Every element of presence on the platform contributes to the overall impression the user will make, and his profile picture is definitely one of the most impactful elements that go a long way towards identity building.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s important to note that Discord users can only use a single profile picture or avatar on the platform, and can’t switch them from one server to another.</strong></em> This rule serves to establish some accountability and familiarity and applies even to server administrators. With that in mind, choosing a great image to represent you everywhere on the Discord platform is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly. To help you do this the right way while respecting all the rules, we prepared a detailed guide for this process.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance"><a href="#Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance"></a>Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</h2><p>Like all other social networks and online communication services, Discord has a set of rules determining whether a certain image is suitable for use as an avatar.</p>
<p>First of all, you have to adhere to a size limit for technical reasons, as too large images would slow down the channel. On the other hand, too small images won’t be legible and can look bad due to pixelization. The most optimal image size you should use for your Discord profile photo is at least <strong>512 x 512 pixels</strong> – enough to be clearly visible and far above the <strong>180 x 180-pixel minimum</strong>.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use your real photo or likeness for your Discord avatar – in fact, you don’t have to use a realistic image at all. Discord allows the use of photographs as well as various types of illustrations and cartoon images and accepts JPG as well as the animated GIF format.</p>
<p>This gives you a lot of freedom to craft your new identity and uses some powerful imagery, either created from scratch or taken from the internet. However, there are still some community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your submission for a profile picture might be rejected for failing to meet Discord’s T&amp;C.</p>
<p>Basically, no NSFW images are allowed on Discord so you will have to avoid anything extreme or controversial. Pornographic content or explicit nudity is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions or promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality. You also need to stay away from violent imagery or anything depicting illegal activity, including drug use, racial discrimination, or mistreatment of animals. While this eliminates a lot of content, it still leaves enough room to express yourself freely without risking offending any other Discord users.</p>

It doesn’t take too much effort to make a fantastic avatar that will be completely unique and tell exactly the story you want. There are many different software tools you can use for this purpose, but since the task is very simple you can use a practical, free program such as Filmora.</p>
<p>The procedure of creating a profile picture for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complex and involves just a few simple steps.</p>
<p>You should start by identifying the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be an animated character or a real-life photo. You can search on Google image or download it from some discord profile sites.</p>
<p>Next, you need to load the selected image into a new project, and then resize the image to fit the preferred dimensions for Discord and change its shape to circular. To change the shape, go to Effects -&gt; Utility -&gt; Image Mask to optimize the image for a Discord avatar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create discord avatar with Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>By adding overlays on top of the basic image, you can also introduce any visual or textual elements that will personalize the avatar even further. To get maximum attention, you might want to use a video or animation as part of the avatar – just add them to overlays and save your file as GIF. Since Discord allows GIF format, you can get an avatar that literally jumps off the page in every chat that you are a part of and elicits a strong reaction from those who see it.</p>

Clicking on this icon will take you to the User settings menu, where you need to find the My Account tab.</p>
<p>Next, hover with your mouse cursor over the current profile picture, then click on the icon that appears right next to it. This action will let you upload an image (JPG or GIF) from your hard drive and make it your new profile picture.</p>

Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?"></a>1. Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?</h4><p>If you experience this problem, it’s most likely a consequence of trying to make too many picture changes too fast. While Discord will allow you to upload two profile images in rapid succession, the third attempt within a few minutes is going to be unsuccessful. The problem will disappear if you wait for a short period of time and try uploading again. Another reason might be that your firewall is preventing you from using an image from a cloud server, but you can easily bypass the issue and download the picture first to your hard disc before uploading it to Discord from there.</p>

You can find this collection of images on a specific portion of your profile page, so if you want to use any of them you can simply click on them without having to go through the regular upload process all over again.</p>

If you see a green dot, the user is available to chat at the moment. A yellow dot indicated an idle user that hasn’t been active in a while, and the red color means the user is busy and doesn’t want to be disturbed. Finally, a gray dot confirms that the user is currently not signed in to his Discord account.</p>

<p>A part of the appeal of the popular multimedia messaging platform Discord is that users can assume online identities that present them in a favorable light. Since Discord serves to enable groups of friends or people with shared interests to communicate in real-time, standing out from the crowd and establishing a well-known and well-liked persona can be very challenging. Every element of presence on the platform contributes to the overall impression the user will make, and his profile picture is definitely one of the most impactful elements that go a long way towards identity building.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s important to note that Discord users can only use a single profile picture or avatar on the platform, and can’t switch them from one server to another.</strong></em> This rule serves to establish some accountability and familiarity and applies even to server administrators. With that in mind, choosing a great image to represent you everywhere on the Discord platform is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly. To help you do this the right way while respecting all the rules, we prepared a detailed guide for this process.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance-1"><a href="#Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance"></a>Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</h2><p>Like all other social networks and online communication services, Discord has a set of rules determining whether a certain image is suitable for use as an avatar.</p>
<p>First of all, you have to adhere to a size limit for technical reasons, as too large images would slow down the channel. On the other hand, too small images won’t be legible and can look bad due to pixelization. The most optimal image size you should use for your Discord profile photo is at least <strong>512 x 512 pixels</strong> – enough to be clearly visible and far above the <strong>180 x 180-pixel minimum</strong>.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use your real photo or likeness for your Discord avatar – in fact, you don’t have to use a realistic image at all. Discord allows the use of photographs as well as various types of illustrations and cartoon images and accepts JPG as well as the animated GIF format.</p>
<p>This gives you a lot of freedom to craft your new identity and uses some powerful imagery, either created from scratch or taken from the internet. However, there are still some community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your submission for a profile picture might be rejected for failing to meet Discord’s T&amp;C.</p>
<p>Basically, no NSFW images are allowed on Discord so you will have to avoid anything extreme or controversial. Pornographic content or explicit nudity is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions or promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality. You also need to stay away from violent imagery or anything depicting illegal activity, including drug use, racial discrimination, or mistreatment of animals. While this eliminates a lot of content, it still leaves enough room to express yourself freely without risking offending any other Discord users.</p>

It doesn’t take too much effort to make a fantastic avatar that will be completely unique and tell exactly the story you want. There are many different software tools you can use for this purpose, but since the task is very simple you can use a practical, free program such as Filmora.</p>
<p>The procedure of creating a profile picture for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complex and involves just a few simple steps.</p>
<p>You should start by identifying the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be an animated character or a real-life photo. You can search on Google image or download it from some discord profile sites.</p>
<p>Next, you need to load the selected image into a new project, and then resize the image to fit the preferred dimensions for Discord and change its shape to circular. To change the shape, go to Effects -&gt; Utility -&gt; Image Mask to optimize the image for a Discord avatar.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="create discord avatar with Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>By adding overlays on top of the basic image, you can also introduce any visual or textual elements that will personalize the avatar even further. To get maximum attention, you might want to use a video or animation as part of the avatar – just add them to overlays and save your file as GIF. Since Discord allows GIF format, you can get an avatar that literally jumps off the page in every chat that you are a part of and elicits a strong reaction from those who see it.</p>

However, this is not done in the same way on different platforms, so you will need to follow the instructions for the type of system you normally use to access your Discord account.</p>

Clicking on this icon will take you to the User settings menu, where you need to find the My Account tab.</p>
<p>Next, hover with your mouse cursor over the current profile picture, then click on the icon that appears right next to it. This action will let you upload an image (JPG or GIF) from your hard drive and make it your new profile picture.</p>

<p>Find the profile picture in the screen that opens, and tap on it to access your phone gallery, then choose the image you would like to use for identification on Discord. It will automatically be uploaded and replace the current image as your only avatar on all Discord channels until it’s changed again.</p>

Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?"></a>1. Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?</h4><p>If you experience this problem, it’s most likely a consequence of trying to make too many picture changes too fast. While Discord will allow you to upload two profile images in rapid succession, the third attempt within a few minutes is going to be unsuccessful. The problem will disappear if you wait for a short period of time and try uploading again. Another reason might be that your firewall is preventing you from using an image from a cloud server, but you can easily bypass the issue and download the picture first to your hard disc before uploading it to Discord from there.</p>

If you see a green dot, the user is available to chat at the moment. A yellow dot indicated an idle user that hasn’t been active in a while, and the red color means the user is busy and doesn’t want to be disturbed. Finally, a gray dot confirms that the user is currently not signed in to his Discord account.</p>

Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?"></a>1. Why can’t I change my profile picture on Discord?</h4><p>If you experience this problem, it’s most likely a consequence of trying to make too many picture changes too fast. While Discord will allow you to upload two profile images in rapid succession, the third attempt within a few minutes is going to be unsuccessful. The problem will disappear if you wait for a short period of time and try uploading again. Another reason might be that your firewall is preventing you from using an image from a cloud server, but you can easily bypass the issue and download the picture first to your hard disc before uploading it to Discord from there.</p>

<p>A part of the appeal of the popular multimedia messaging platform Discord is that users can assume online identities that present them in a favorable light. Since Discord serves to enable groups of friends or people with shared interests to communicate in real-time, standing out from the crowd and establishing a well-known and well-liked persona can be very challenging. Every element of presence on the platform contributes to the overall impression the user will make, and his profile picture is definitely one of the most impactful elements that go a long way towards identity building.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s important to note that Discord users can only use a single profile picture or avatar on the platform, and can’t switch them from one server to another.</strong></em> This rule serves to establish some accountability and familiarity and applies even to server administrators. With that in mind, choosing a great image to represent you everywhere on the Discord platform is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly. To help you do this the right way while respecting all the rules, we prepared a detailed guide for this process.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance-3"><a href="#Part-1-Discord-Profile-Picture-Size-and-Content-Guidance-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance"></a>Part 1: Discord Profile Picture Size and Content Guidance</h2><p>Like all other social networks and online communication services, Discord has a set of rules determining whether a certain image is suitable for use as an avatar.</p>
<p>First of all, you have to adhere to a size limit for technical reasons, as too large images would slow down the channel. On the other hand, too small images won’t be legible and can look bad due to pixelization. The most optimal image size you should use for your Discord profile photo is at least <strong>512 x 512 pixels</strong> – enough to be clearly visible and far above the <strong>180 x 180-pixel minimum</strong>.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use your real photo or likeness for your Discord avatar – in fact, you don’t have to use a realistic image at all. Discord allows the use of photographs as well as various types of illustrations and cartoon images and accepts JPG as well as the animated GIF format.</p>
<p>This gives you a lot of freedom to craft your new identity and uses some powerful imagery, either created from scratch or taken from the internet. However, there are still some community standards that you’ll have to meet in terms of image content, or your submission for a profile picture might be rejected for failing to meet Discord’s T&amp;C.</p>
<p>Basically, no NSFW images are allowed on Discord so you will have to avoid anything extreme or controversial. Pornographic content or explicit nudity is not welcome on this platform, and the same goes for showing minors in any sexually suggestive positions or promoting non-consensual forms of sexuality. You also need to stay away from violent imagery or anything depicting illegal activity, including drug use, racial discrimination, or mistreatment of animals. While this eliminates a lot of content, it still leaves enough room to express yourself freely without risking offending any other Discord users.</p>

It doesn’t take too much effort to make a fantastic avatar that will be completely unique and tell exactly the story you want. There are many different software tools you can use for this purpose, but since the task is very simple you can use a practical, free program such as Filmora.</p>
<p>The procedure of creating a profile picture for Discord in a visual suite like Filmora is not very complex and involves just a few simple steps.</p>
<p>You should start by identifying the picture that will form the basis of your avatar – it can be an animated character or a real-life photo. You can search on Google image or download it from some discord profile sites.</p>
<p>Next, you need to load the selected image into a new project, and then resize the image to fit the preferred dimensions for Discord and change its shape to circular. To change the shape, go to Effects -&gt; Utility -&gt; Image Mask to optimize the image for a Discord avatar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-overlay-image-mask-discord-profile-wondershare-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="create discord avatar with Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>By adding overlays on top of the basic image, you can also introduce any visual or textual elements that will personalize the avatar even further. To get maximum attention, you might want to use a video or animation as part of the avatar – just add them to overlays and save your file as GIF. Since Discord allows GIF format, you can get an avatar that literally jumps off the page in every chat that you are a part of and elicits a strong reaction from those who see it.</p>
