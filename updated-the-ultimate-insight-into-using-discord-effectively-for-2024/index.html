<h2 id="What-Is-Discord"><a href="#What-Is-Discord" class="headerlink" title="What Is Discord?"></a>What Is Discord?</h2><p>Discord has everything you need in a good communication software with its voice chats, video calls, and text options. These let users get in touch with each other, which works perfectly for gamers to form communities, coordinate, and talk while playing.</p>
<p>Primarily a chat app, it makes chatting while playing games on PC very convenient. However, it is not just used by gamers, as a lot of people use it as a social and organizational tool.</p>
<p>This past year, Discord has become the default destination for Youtubers, influencers, and Instagrammers who want to build a community around their content and connect with audiences in a more meaningful way.</p>
<h2 id="How-Does-Discord-Work-And-What-Can-It-Be-Used-For"><a href="#How-Does-Discord-Work-And-What-Can-It-Be-Used-For" class="headerlink" title="How Does Discord Work And What Can It Be Used For?"></a>How Does Discord Work And What Can It Be Used For?</h2><p>Discord is simply a communication software that allows the users to message or call one another. There are different communities on it, and each one is called a server, with individual text and voice channels for you to join. You can type, voice-chat, and share videos, links, images, music, etc.</p>
<p>You’ll find that each channel has a unique topic or rules; for instance, one channel could be dedicated to games while another to sharing pictures of dogs, etc.</p>
<p>Discord serves as a social forum where people form private or public servers and discuss their shared interests. You can even start your own server if you can’t find any worth joining for free. Try A Google search to find discord servers on your preferred topic or use the app’s own search engine to look for a new channel.</p>
<p>Who doesn’t like GIFs?</p>
<p>Discord allows you to add GIFs to your chats or mark your messages as spoilers using the “&#x2F;giphy” or “&#x2F;spoiler” commands, respectively.</p>
<p>It also lets you reach out to other people and directly message them to have a video or voice chat with them. Furthermore, it can also connect to other apps like Spotify or YouTube to improve your experience.</p>
<p>No matter what other activity you are doing, you can use Discord along with it. For instance, if your friends want to play a game, you can all launch the same Discord server and use any device to access it. Smack talk your friends’ Mortal Combat or Street Fighter skills to your heart’s content – no one’s judging!</p>
<p>Interestingly, day traders and investors also hopped on the bandwagon because it lets them multitask and stay connected like a pro.</p>
<p>If these features weren’t enough, Discord is also free to download and use. And if you love the experience of Discord, you can always upgrade and subscribe to Discord Nitro.</p>
<p>While Discord itself provides you a fantastic experience, Nitro improves it by many folds. It lets you access more features like larger file uploads, animated emojis, better-quality streaming options, and a lot more, only for $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year!</p>
<h2 id="What-Makes-Discord-Standout"><a href="#What-Makes-Discord-Standout" class="headerlink" title="What Makes Discord Standout?"></a>What Makes Discord Standout?</h2><p>There’s a reason why Discord has managed to garner over <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/746215/discord-user-number/" >300 million <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> registered users as of June 2020. Even though you can find many communication tools, the variety of chat options makes Discord stand out amongst others.</p>
<h3 id="1-Easy-To-Use-Interface"><a href="#1-Easy-To-Use-Interface" class="headerlink" title="1. Easy-To-Use Interface"></a>1. Easy-To-Use Interface</h3><p>Don’t we all look for an easy-to-use interface in the apps or websites we use?</p>
<p>Discord has a good UI along with all the best features from communication apps like Slack and Skype. It also puts in a lot of effort in making the voice chat more efficient so that it is of real help while playing games.</p>
<h3 id="2-Provides-A-Social-Forum"><a href="#2-Provides-A-Social-Forum" class="headerlink" title="2. Provides A Social Forum"></a>2. Provides A Social Forum</h3><p>One of the best things about Discord is that it is more than just a communications software. Users actually take advantage of its chat options to meet and talk to other like-minded people making it a great social media platform.</p>
<p>This means that Discord isn’t only good for gamers. You can use the private server to interact with friends or the public ones to make new ones.</p>
<h3 id="3-Setting-Up-Member-Roles"><a href="#3-Setting-Up-Member-Roles" class="headerlink" title="3. Setting Up Member Roles"></a>3. Setting Up Member Roles</h3><p>Another one of Discord’s advantage is that you can use various ways to configure its server when you create one. You can establish different roles for the community members, like making one for other moderators and administrators or special functions for the most active users.</p>
<p>This makes your server easier to manage, while the experience is quite rewarding for active users.</p>
<h3 id="4-Accessibility"><a href="#4-Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="4. Accessibility"></a>4. Accessibility</h3><p>As you will read below, one of the best facets of Discord is that you can use it even if you do not have a gaming PC in front of you. The web-based and mobile versions are relatively easy to use. At the same time, the downloadable PC program runs in the background while you play your games.</p>
<p>You can use its chat servers to interact with people from pretty much anywhere due to the multitude of platforms available.</p>
<h2 id="Where-Can-You-Use-Discord"><a href="#Where-Can-You-Use-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Where Can You Use Discord?"></a>Where Can You Use Discord?</h2><p>Whether you have Windows or Mac, you can download and use the app effortlessly.</p>
<p>You can also use it in-browser at its official website, though there are some limitations. For example, you won’t be able to detect audio devices or a webcam and screen-sharing feature to stream desktops or windows to other people.</p>
<p>If you want to use it on the go, try the iOS and Android apps that offer relatively similar features as the desktop one. They have recently added the screen sharing feature to the mobile version as well making it accessible for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Get-Started-On-Discord"><a href="#How-to-Get-Started-On-Discord" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Started On Discord?"></a>How to Get Started On Discord?</h2><p>Follow the guide below if you want to join Discord:</p>
<h3 id="1-Creating-A-Discord-Account"><a href="#1-Creating-A-Discord-Account" class="headerlink" title="1.  Creating A Discord Account"></a>1.  Creating A Discord Account</h3><p>Once you have downloaded Discord on your device, click on the register link option, and create an account. Fill out the fields with relevant information, including the email you will use. Then create a username and password, and hit the “Continue” button to proceed.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve entered the world of Discord. Do check your email to verify your account so you can enjoy the full functionality of this app. In case you haven’t received it, click the resend button.</p>
<h3 id="2-Joining-A-Server"><a href="#2-Joining-A-Server" class="headerlink" title="2.  Joining A Server"></a>2.  Joining A Server</h3><p>Creating your account is just the beginning. Let’s get to the most exciting bit, which is joining a server!</p>
<p>First and foremost, find the perfect server to join as there are many resources available. You can find different server communities through the search option. You can optimize your search by typing in a keyword to find one focused on a topic of your interest.</p>
<p>You will see servers pop up once you type in your keyword. Just click on the display card of the one that’s in line with your interests. It’s also possible to view the server before you join, and if you like it, you can select the “Join Server” option.</p>
<p>A little icon near the magnifying glass and the plus signs on the screen will be added representing the server you have joined; click on it to rejoin the server whenever you want.</p>
<h3 id="3-Adding-Friends"><a href="#3-Adding-Friends" class="headerlink" title="3.  Adding Friends"></a>3.  Adding Friends</h3><p>Adding friends is another exciting part of Discord, which is luckily very straightforward. Follow the easy guide to do so.</p>
<p>In the “Friends” tab, you can see options on the dashboard. Click on the green “Add friend” button to add someone. A screen will appear that will ask you to enter a friend’s username and #number. Press the “Send Friend Request” option after this, and you would have added your first friend!</p>
<p>You can find your username along with the number at the bottom of your dashboard, which you can let a friend know who wants to add you.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As you would’ve already gathered from above, Discord is a very cool and useful app. It is not just meant for communication but to also build a social platform where you can meet other people and form communities around the same interests.</p>

Provides A Social Forum</h3><p>One of the best things about Discord is that it is more than just a communications software. Users actually take advantage of its chat options to meet and talk to other like-minded people making it a great social media platform.</p>
<p>This means that Discord isn’t only good for gamers. You can use the private server to interact with friends or the public ones to make new ones.</p>
<h3 id="3-Setting-Up-Member-Roles-3"><a href="#3-Setting-Up-Member-Roles-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Setting Up Member Roles"></a>3. Setting Up Member Roles</h3><p>Another one of Discord’s advantage is that you can use various ways to configure its server when you create one. You can establish different roles for the community members, like making one for other moderators and administrators or special functions for the most active users.</p>
<p>This makes your server easier to manage, while the experience is quite rewarding for active users.</p>
<h3 id="4-Accessibility-3"><a href="#4-Accessibility-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Accessibility"></a>4. Accessibility</h3><p>As you will read below, one of the best facets of Discord is that you can use it even if you do not have a gaming PC in front of you. The web-based and mobile versions are relatively easy to use. At the same time, the downloadable PC program runs in the background while you play your games.</p>
<p>You can use its chat servers to interact with people from pretty much anywhere due to the multitude of platforms available.</p>
<h2 id="Where-Can-You-Use-Discord-3"><a href="#Where-Can-You-Use-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="Where Can You Use Discord?"></a>Where Can You Use Discord?</h2><p>Whether you have Windows or Mac, you can download and use the app effortlessly.</p>
<p>You can also use it in-browser at its official website, though there are some limitations. For example, you won’t be able to detect audio devices or a webcam and screen-sharing feature to stream desktops or windows to other people.</p>
<p>If you want to use it on the go, try the iOS and Android apps that offer relatively similar features as the desktop one. They have recently added the screen sharing feature to the mobile version as well making it accessible for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Get-Started-On-Discord-3"><a href="#How-to-Get-Started-On-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Started On Discord?"></a>How to Get Started On Discord?</h2><p>Follow the guide below if you want to join Discord:</p>

<p>While most users of the popular online messaging and content sharing site Discord rely on simple text to communicate, there are numerous situations when using the text-to-speech feature would be quite advantageous. This includes instances when there are language barriers or disabilities to overcome, but also spontaneous moments when users just enjoy hearing each other’s words. Discord supports the use of a text-to-speech (TTS) function and in fact, has a built-in setting for it, but this option only works for desktop users with Windows or Mac devices.</p>
<p>In this article, we will discuss the specifics of activating the TTS function in Discord and using it effectively to improve your communication with other users. By following the detailed instructions provided here, you will be able to learn how to activate text-to-speech on Discord and manage your voice messages on selected servers in the most practical manner.</p>

This isn’t hard to do – just go to the Discord app and select ‘Settings’ from the menu, which will trigger a pop-up window to appear on your screen. Next, you need to find the <strong>Text &amp; Images</strong> section in the App Settings window, then scroll down to find the <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> option, and finally tick the boxes next to <strong>Allow playback and Usage of TTS</strong> items. After you do this, your Discord will be ready to process your text messages in voice format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Discord Text to Speech Settings"
                ></p>
<p>To test whether you successfully activated Text-to-Speech, open any chats on your personal server and try typing out a message, followed immediately by the tag &#x2F;tts. If everything is working correctly, your message should appear on the screen in the text form, accompanied by its voice rendering delivered by an automated module. The timing of the two should be perfectly synchronized so that you hear the message and see the text at exactly the same instance. Otherwise, go back to settings and make sure you activated the TTS option properly or restart your Discord app.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Set-Up-Text-To-Speech-Notifications-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Set-Up-Text-To-Speech-Notifications-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Set Up Text-To-Speech Notifications on Discord?"></a>Part 2: How to Set Up Text-To-Speech Notifications on Discord?</h2><p>Another practical possibility that can improve your Discord experience is to set up TTS notifications and be immediately informed whenever a fresh message arrives. This can also be done after you change the app parameters from the ‘Settings’ menu. After you see all options, choose ‘App Settings’ and search for the section named ‘Notifications’. By scrolling down, you will reach the item ‘Text-to-Speech notifications’ and after clicking on it you will be given a choice between three options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-text-to-speech-notification-settings.jpg"
                      alt="Discord Text to Speech Notification Settings"
                ></p>
<p>The first option <strong>For all channels</strong> is to enable notifications on all channels on Discord; choosing it will result in a robotic voice reading all messages from all chats, regardless of whether they have a &#x2F;tts tag. This option can be useful when you want to maximize your accessibility and receive important information instantly.</p>
<p>By picking the second option, <strong>For current selected channel</strong>, you can enable TTS notifications only on the current channel. This action will instruct Discord to have an automated voice read all the incoming messages on the active chat aloud, allowing you to stay in the loop at all times. This possibility works well for people who occasionally do multiple things at once, for example, gamers or streamers who use Discord to stay connected with their fans and friends while they are busy.</p>
<p>Finally, you can choose <strong>Never</strong> to hear any voice messages from your Discord chats never. If you pick this setting, even those messages that were sent with the &#x2F;tts tag will only be displayed in the text format. This option provides you with peace of mind and prevents spammers from saturating you with voice messages you have no interest in hearing.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-in-Discord-Chatting"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-in-Discord-Chatting" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech in Discord Chatting?"></a>Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech in Discord Chatting?</h2><p>It’s not very hard to learn how to effectively use the TTS option in your chats on the Discord platform. This communication format is available on all channels that have an activated Text-to-Speech setting, so you can freely add a few messages to be read aloud or completely switch to automated voice format if you so desire. Doing this in practice is very simple – just start your message by typing the tag &#x2F;tts and then enter your text as you normally would.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Send  Discord Text to Speech Message"
                ></p>
<p>Your TTS message will be reproduced in a voice format by a Discord bot to all participants in the chat who didn’t mute incoming Text-to-Speech chats. An automated voice will say the entire message, and then also pronounce your username to identify the author. At the same time, the message will appear in the chat feed as plain text, so that even those recipients unable to hear it will be able to see the contents.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Mute-All-Text-To-Speech-Messages-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Mute-All-Text-To-Speech-Messages-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Mute All Text-To-Speech Messages on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Mute All Text-To-Speech Messages on Discord?</h2><p>You can also decide to prevent any messages from being played to you in a voice format and receive them as text only. This option is available even if you are not the administrator of the chat server and simply want to customize your own experience. To do this, you need to open the Discord app and enter the Settings menu, before selecting the Text &amp; Images section from App Settings. After this, you need to find the Text-to-Speech sub-menu and open it to find the Allow Playback feature. If you disable this feature, you will effectively mute all incoming TTS messages across all Discord servers you are active on.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Disable  Discord Text to Speech Settings"
                ></p>
<p>Please keep in mind that deactivating the aforementioned feature won’t block TTS messages from reaching you, but you will see them as text only. On the other hand, you can’t use the &#x2F;tts tag to send your own Text-to-Speech while the playback setting is disabled. Nothing is preventing you from turning it back on when you want to have a TTS capacity on Discord again.</p>

There are several great Bots that can be used for Text-to-Speech, so you might consider utilizing one of them.</p>

This option is available even if you are not the administrator of the chat server and simply want to customize your own experience. To do this, you need to open the Discord app and enter the Settings menu, before selecting the Text &amp; Images section from App Settings. After this, you need to find the Text-to-Speech sub-menu and open it to find the Allow Playback feature. If you disable this feature, you will effectively mute all incoming TTS messages across all Discord servers you are active on.</p>

<p>While most users of the popular online messaging and content sharing site Discord rely on simple text to communicate, there are numerous situations when using the text-to-speech feature would be quite advantageous. This includes instances when there are language barriers or disabilities to overcome, but also spontaneous moments when users just enjoy hearing each other’s words. Discord supports the use of a text-to-speech (TTS) function and in fact, has a built-in setting for it, but this option only works for desktop users with Windows or Mac devices.</p>
<p>In this article, we will discuss the specifics of activating the TTS function in Discord and using it effectively to improve your communication with other users. By following the detailed instructions provided here, you will be able to learn how to activate text-to-speech on Discord and manage your voice messages on selected servers in the most practical manner.</p>

This isn’t hard to do – just go to the Discord app and select ‘Settings’ from the menu, which will trigger a pop-up window to appear on your screen. Next, you need to find the <strong>Text &amp; Images</strong> section in the App Settings window, then scroll down to find the <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> option, and finally tick the boxes next to <strong>Allow playback and Usage of TTS</strong> items. After you do this, your Discord will be ready to process your text messages in voice format.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>To test whether you successfully activated Text-to-Speech, open any chats on your personal server and try typing out a message, followed immediately by the tag &#x2F;tts. If everything is working correctly, your message should appear on the screen in the text form, accompanied by its voice rendering delivered by an automated module. The timing of the two should be perfectly synchronized so that you hear the message and see the text at exactly the same instance. Otherwise, go back to settings and make sure you activated the TTS option properly or restart your Discord app.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Set-Up-Text-To-Speech-Notifications-on-Discord-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Set-Up-Text-To-Speech-Notifications-on-Discord-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Set Up Text-To-Speech Notifications on Discord?"></a>Part 2: How to Set Up Text-To-Speech Notifications on Discord?</h2><p>Another practical possibility that can improve your Discord experience is to set up TTS notifications and be immediately informed whenever a fresh message arrives. This can also be done after you change the app parameters from the ‘Settings’ menu. After you see all options, choose ‘App Settings’ and search for the section named ‘Notifications’. By scrolling down, you will reach the item ‘Text-to-Speech notifications’ and after clicking on it you will be given a choice between three options.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>The first option <strong>For all channels</strong> is to enable notifications on all channels on Discord; choosing it will result in a robotic voice reading all messages from all chats, regardless of whether they have a &#x2F;tts tag. This option can be useful when you want to maximize your accessibility and receive important information instantly.</p>
<p>By picking the second option, <strong>For current selected channel</strong>, you can enable TTS notifications only on the current channel. This action will instruct Discord to have an automated voice read all the incoming messages on the active chat aloud, allowing you to stay in the loop at all times. This possibility works well for people who occasionally do multiple things at once, for example, gamers or streamers who use Discord to stay connected with their fans and friends while they are busy.</p>
<p>Finally, you can choose <strong>Never</strong> to hear any voice messages from your Discord chats never. If you pick this setting, even those messages that were sent with the &#x2F;tts tag will only be displayed in the text format. This option provides you with peace of mind and prevents spammers from saturating you with voice messages you have no interest in hearing.</p>

This communication format is available on all channels that have an activated Text-to-Speech setting, so you can freely add a few messages to be read aloud or completely switch to automated voice format if you so desire. Doing this in practice is very simple – just start your message by typing the tag &#x2F;tts and then enter your text as you normally would.</p>

<li><strong>Can I use the Text-to-Speech feature on Discord from a mobile phone?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, you can’t. Discord works quite well as a text messaging app on mobile platforms, but at this time Text-to-Speech functionality is limited to desktop users.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why can’t I use Text-to-Speech on a Discord server?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are unable to send or receive TTS messages on Discord, you need to change your settings. Please see Part 1 of this article for detailed instructions.</p>
